<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Critical Theory Today : A User-Friendly Guide (Garland Reference Library of the Humanities)</h2><p>This accessible guide offers a thorough introduction to contemporary critical theory. It provides in-depth coverage of the most common approaches to literary analysis today: feminism, psychoanalysis, Marxism, reader-response theory, new criticism, structuralism and semiotics, deconstruction, new historicism, cultural criticism, lesbian/gay/queer theory, African-American criticism, and postcolonial criticism. The chapters provide an extended explanation of each theory, using examples from everyday life, popular culture, and literary texts; a list of specific questions critics who use that theory ask about literary texts; an interpretation of F. Scott Fitzgerald&#39;s The Great Gatsby through the lens of each theory; a list of questions for further practice to guide readers in applying each theory to different literary works; and a bibliography of primary and secondary works for further reading.</p><p>&#34;Wise and helpful, inspiriting and provocative, reassuring and calming, comprehensive and convincing....should be adopted as an exemplar of how critical theory can be accommodated and described without sacrificing clarity and seriousness of purpose. If only those producing critical theory could hew to the expository and pedagogical standards of this volume, theory would be much more accepted as a valid and necessary part of contemporary social and intellectual life rather than as a...series of codes and ritual practised by an academic clerisy.&#34; -David Greetham, Distinguished Professor, City University of New York, Graduate Center &#34;Tyson has covered the entire range of current theories and presents them in accessible prose....she makes psychoanalysis come alive as a body of ideas that can help the students learn important things about their lives and, as a result, about Literature....it is better than any other work I have seen....I would use it as the text in an introduction to theory for undergraduates....also be a regular source in a number of other courses, since its coverage of a range of theories makes it a fine starting point in numerous cases.&#34; -Walter A. Davis, Professor of English, The Ohio State University &#34;Tyson&#39;s incomparable critical theory textbook is the long-awaited answer to my prayers....While it is intellectually rigorous, it is a kinder, gentler theory text which prioritizes encouraging students to reach and enabling them to meet its challenges, rather than intimidating and debilitating them with pretentious jargon....uniquely accessible....Tyson&#39;s respectful and thoughtful negotiation of the lesbian/gay/queer theory chapter is particularlyoutstanding....a tour-de-force which puts others to shame and should inhabit every personal and professional academic library....we owe her a world of gratitude for this enlightening, passionate achievement.&#34; -Roseanne Hoefel, Department of English, Alma College &#34;The very best thing by far that has been done in the field....clear coverage of every major field in literary criticism without sacrifice of accuracy....written from a uniquely integrated theoretical perspective, it could easily be used in philosophy as well as English literature classes.&#34; -Alan Hausman, Department of Philosophy, Hunter College, City University of New York</p><h2>Teaching Music through Performance in Band, Vol. 1 (Second Edition) /G4484</h2><p>Newly revised and expanded Second Edition!

(Great Illustrated Classics)</h2><p>In 1751 in Scotland, cheated out of his inheritance by a greedy uncle who has him kidnapped and put on a ship to the Carolinas, seventeen-year-old David Balfour escapes to the Highlands with the help of the Jacobite Alan Breck Stewart and there encounters further danger and intrigue as he attempts to clear his name and regain his property.In 1751 in Scotland, cheated out of his inheritance by a greedy uncle who has him kidnapped and put on a ship to the Carolinas, seventeen-year-old David Balfour escapes to the Highlands with the help of the Jacobite Alan Breck Stewart and there encounters further danger and intrigue as he attempts to clear his name and regain his property.</p><p>Robert Louis Stevenson always considered &#34;Kidnapped,&#34; the tale of 17-year-old David Balfour&#39;s adventures in the remote islands and highlands of Scotland with renegade soldier Alan Breck Stewart, to be his greatest novel, but when the classic adventure tale was published in 1886, it was missing much of what its author held dear. His English publisher had excised many of the Scottish words and phrases he had used to evoke the suspense of the novel. From simple misreadings to deliberate revisions, subsequent printed editions represented major departures from Stevenson&#39;s handwritten text. Now Barry Menikoff has restored the author&#39;s language and punctuation, as well as the authentic Scots quality of his diction. In doing so, he has given readers a clearer picture of both Stevenson&#39;s skill as a storyteller and the novel&#39;s social and political context.For the better part of a century &#34;Kidnapped&#34; has occupied an ambiguous position in literary and cultural studies. Its initial appearance in a weekly magazine called &#34;Young Folks Paper,&#34; along with Stevenson&#39;s disingenuous comment that the novel had a diverting rather than a serious aim, have in effect trapped the book in the never-neverland of children&#39;s literature. Yet it is universally acknowledges as a classic of world literature and the novelist always considered it his finest achievement -- taken together with its sequel, &#34;David Balfour,&#34; the best he was capable of in fiction. Now, for the first readers can plainly see why Stevenson placed his story of David Balfour on so high a pedestal. Drawing on the unique autograph manuscript in California&#39;s Huntington Library, Professor Barry Menikoff faithfully reproduces the text as Stevenson originally wrote it, restoring the punctuation (of which the novelist was a master) and recovering the distinctive and often singular language that had been altered or deleted. The effect is to deepen and illuminate the Scottish texture of the novel. For a book so embedded in Scottish history as &#34;Kidnapped,&#34; so revelatory of its fierce loyalties and violent enmities, the discovery that Stevenson was even more nationalistic than we had known comes at an opportune moment, with the opening of the new Scottish parliament. This handsome new edition of a novel whose avowed purpose was the recovery of an important part of Scots history reproduces for the first time the original drawings that accompanied the text during its serialization in &#34;Young Folks.&#34; Professor Menikoff&#39;s substantial introduction situates the book in its cultural context, and enables us to see why Stevenson&#39;s contemporaries were both entranced and awed by his achievement. And in his extensive notes to the novel he reveals Stevenson&#39;s enormous prestige as an authority on language, both English and Scots, for &#34;Kidnapped&#34; was widely drawn upon as a reference by lexicographers for the &#34;Oxford English Dictionary&#34; and the &#34;Scottish National Dictionary.&#34; Finally, for a tale that charts the &#34;wanderings&#34; of David Balfour over the land and seas of Scotland, this edition is the first to provide a gazetteer of place-names encountered during the course of those travels.</p><h2>Hematology in Clinical Practice, Fifth Edition (LANGE Clinical Medicine)</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note:&nbsp;Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b><b><i></i></b></p><p></p><p></p><br><br><p><b>The most practical and efficient guide to the diagnosis and management of blood disorders &#x2013; now in full color</b></p><p><b><i>200 full-color illustrations!</i></b></p><p><i>Hematology in Clinical Practice</i> is a succinct, cutting-edge guide to the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of red blood cells, white blood cells, and hemostasis, and the use of blood components for transfusion.

Timberlake chronicles the intellectual, political, and economic developments that prompted the use of central banking institutions to regulate the monetary systems.<br> <br> After describing the constitutional principles that the Founding Fathers laid down to prevent state and federal governments from printing money. Timberlake shows how the First and Second Banks of the United States gradually assumed the central banking powers that were originally denied them. Drawing on congressional debates, government documents, and other primary sources, he analyses the origins and constitutionality of the greenbacks and examines the evolution of clearinghouse associations as private lenders of last resort. He completes this history with a study of the legislation that fundamentally changed the power and scope of the Federal Reserve System&#x2014;the Banking Act of 1935 and the Monetary Control Act of 1980.<br> <br> Writing in nontechnical language, Timberlake demystifies two centuries of monetary policy. He concludes that central banking has been largely a series of politically inspired government-serving actions that have burdened the private economy.</p></p><p></p><h2>American Consumer Society, 1865 - 2005: From Hearth to HDTV</h2><p><p>This startlingly original and highly readable volume adds a new richness and depth to an element of U.S. history that is all too often taken for granted. In American Consumer Society, Regina Lee Blaszczyk examines the emergence of consumerism in the Victorian era, and, in tracing its evolution over the next 140 years, shows how the emergence of a mass market was followed by its fragmentation. Niche marketing focused on successive waves of new consumers as each made its presence known: Irish immigrants, urban African Americans, teenagers, computer geeks, and soccer moms, to name but a few.</p> <p>Blaszczyk demonstrates that middle-class consumerism is an intrinsic part of American identity, but exactly how consumerism reflected that identity changed over time. Initially driven to imitate those who had already achieved success, Americans eventually began to use their purchases to express themselves. This led to a fundamental change in American culture&#x2014;one in which the American reverence for things was replaced by a passion for experiences. New Millennium families no longer treasured exquisite china or dress in fine clothes, but they&#x2019;ll spare no expense on being able to make phone calls, retrieve emails, watch ESPN, or visit web sites at any place, any time. Victorian mothers just wouldn&#x2019;t understand.</p> <p>Using materials and techniques from business history, art history, anthropology, sociology, material culture, and good story-telling, this lavishly illustrated and highly thoughtful narrative offers a compelling re-interpretation of American culture through the lens of consumerism, making it perfect for use not only as supplementary reading in the U.S. survey, but also for a variety of courses in Business, Culture, Economics, Marketing, and Fashion and Design history.</p></p><p><p><b>Reginal Lee Blaszczyk</b>, Visiting Scholar in the Department of the History and Sociology of Science at the University of Pennsylvania, received a B.A. from Marlboro College, an M.A. from George Washington University, and an M.A. and Ph.D. from the Hagley Program at the University of Delaware. A specialist in the history of capitalism and consumer culture, Blaszczyk has published numerous books, articles, and reviews. Her first book, <i>Imagining Consumers: Design and Innovation from Wedgwood to Corning</i> (2000), received the Hagley Prize for the Best Book in Business History for 2001, and her co-edited reader, <i>Major Problems in American Business History; Documents and Essays</i> (2006), is widely used in courses on American capitalism. <i>Partners in Innovation: Science Education and the Science Workforce</i> (edited; 2005) considers the skills needed to compete in the global business environment, while <i>Producing Fashion: Commerce, Culture, and Consumers</i> (edited; 2008) suggests new approaches to the history of fashion, business, and consumer culture.</p> <p>Blaszczyk has received fellowships from Harvard University&#x2019;s Charles Warren Center for Studies n American History, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Chemical Heritage Foundation. She has taught at Boston University, Rutgers University-Camden, the University of Delaware, and the University of Pennsylvania, and spent eleven years as a cultural history curator at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. In 2008, she received the Harold F. Williamson Prize in Business History for mid-career achievement from the Business History Conference, the largest international association of business historians.</p>"[<i>American Consumer Society</i>] is a clearly written, well-illustrated exploration of American consumerism, attentive to the need to define terms and make cultural references appropriate for college students today. This book draws on essential and revealing statistics and offers memorable stories to drive home themes. ...Blaszczyk does more than survey her topic. She offers original research from her scholarship on the history of design, advertising, and fashion...whatever your view, you will find this book a gold mine of information and analysis, and an example of just good writing." (Harvard Business School <i>Business History Review</i>, Winter 2009)</p><h2>Magical Mushrooms, Mischievous Molds</h2><p><p>Mushrooms magically spew forth from the earth in the hours that follow a summer rain. Fuzzy brown molds mischievously turn forgotten peaches to slime in the kitchen fruit bowl. And in thousands of other ways, members of the kingdom Fungi do their part to make life on Earth the miracle that it is. In this lively book, George Hudler leads us on a tour of an often-overlooked group of organisms, which differ radically from both animals and plants. Along the way the author stops to ponder the marvels of nature and the impact of mere microbes on the evolution of civilization. Nature's ultimate recyclers not only save us from drowning in a sea of organic waste, but also provide us with food, drink, and a wide array of valuable medicines and industrial chemicals.</p><br><p> Some fungi make deadly poisons and psychedelic drugs that have interesting histories in and of themselves, and Hudler weaves tales of those into his scientific account of the nature of the fungi. The role of fungi in the Irish potato famine, in the Salem Witch Trials, in the philosophical writings of Greek scholars, and in the creation of ginger snaps are just a few of the many great moments in history to grace these pages.</p><br><p> Hudler moves so easily from discussing human history to exploring scientific knowledge, all with a sense of humor and enthusiasm, that one can well understand why he is an award-winning teacher both at Cornell University as well as nationally. Few, for instance, who read his invitation to "get out of your chair and take a short walk" will ever again look without curiosity and admiration at the "rotten" part of the world around them. <i>Magical Mushrooms, Mischievous Molds </i>is full of information that will satisfy history buffs, science enthusiasts, and anyone interested in nature's miracles. Everyone in Hudler's audience will develop a new appreciation of the debt they owe to the molds for such common products as penicillin, wine, and bread.</p></p><p>Oh, to be young and eligible to enroll in Professor George Hudler's "Plant Pathology 101" class at Cornell! For those of us who aren't, this book is the next best thing--a hugely entertaining introduction to spore lore. Not only does he bring us up to speed on the fungus science, he relates the amazing impact of his branch of science on human history. The Eleusinian Mysteries that so inspired Plato and Sophocles were probably caused by ergot, which Tim Leary and the CIA put to scarier use in its refined form, LSD. Other fungal products are more upbeat: penicillin (Hudler tells a good story about British scientists who put its spores on their clothes in 1940, to preserve their research in case Germany invaded), cyclosporins, which permit such organ recipients as David Crosby not to reject their healthy new livers, and Beano, a derivative of alpha-d-galactosidase that suppresses flatulence in humans. Want to commit the perfect murder? Try aflatoxin, as a Graham Greene character does in <i>The Human Factor</i>. Do you dare to recreate the hallucinations of the Salem witches? Ergot's just the thing, as characters discover to their misfortune in Robin Cook's thriller <i>Acceptable Risk</i>. Hudler packs plenty of intriguing stories into a brief, readable book: exploding artillery fungus, spores spread by earthquakes that can cause anorexia, a 35-acre spread of 1,500-year-old identical mushrooms in Michigan that may be the oldest, biggest living thing on Earth. No question about it--Dr. Hudler is one fun guy. <i>--Tim Appelo</i><p>"Hudler's light-hearted approach to the subject of the impact of fungi on human history is refreshing and will attract students and lay people who have some interest in this area. Better yet, it will entice readers who were not concerned with this topic at all before delving into the book. . . . [Hudler] is to be commended for discovering some extremely exciting information, some of it little known even to mycologists."--<b>James W. Kimbrough, University of Florida</b></p></p><h2>German Hunting Guns of the Golden Era: 1840-1940</h2><p>No other nation excelled in building complicated combination guns of very high quality like the Germans. The period 1840 till 1940 saw some of the finest break-open shotguns, rifles, drillings, and other combination guns made in this country. Their history is fascinating, the guns built before 1939 category exhibit a high level of quality and finish. In the devastation following two world wars, the records of the origins and the production of fine German sporting arms were mostly lost. This book-the first and only of its kind-documents as much as possible the history and aspects of these fascinating guns whose mechanism and complexity are unsurpassed. Research material was gathered from old catalogs and ads, factory records, books, periodicals, individuals, and, of course, surviving firearms of the period covered by this book. The book is divided into three sections: "Hunting," "Gunmakers," and "The Gun Itself." These three sections capture the essence of the topics through the use of photos and illustrations. Long, explanatory captions make the pictures understandable even to the novice. Moreover, all the famous makers of the day are included: J. P. Sauer, Brenneke, Lindner, Sempert &amp; Krieghoff, and others. Everything to do with break-open shotguns, rifles, drillings, and combination guns is discussed: the Frank drilling, the barrel, the action, the development and history of these guns, fences, set triggers, and so on. This is a must-have book for all who appreciate fine, complex and beautifully made guns, both in metal artistry and in wood work. The German gun enthusiast especially will marvel at the geniuses of a bygone day that invented and built such guns.</p><p></p><h2>Practical Psychoanalysis for Therapists and Patients</h2><p><b>A clear and readable how-to manual for results-oriented psychoanalysis.</b><br><br>By now, the term "practical psychoanalysis" has become an oxymoron. The way psychoanalytic treatment is generally conducted is extremely impractical and doesn't serve the needs of the vast majority of potential patients, who want to achieve maximum relief from emotional distress as quickly as possible. This unfortunate state of affairs is ironic, considering that psychoanalysis became popular on the basis of its therapeutic efficacy.<br><br>In this essential new book, Owen Renik describes how clinical psychoanalysis can focus on symptom relief and deliver results efficiently. With a humane, direct, and engaging voice, he takes up how to begin treatment, how to end it, and how to deal with the in-between. He offers chapters on the therapy of panic attacks and depersonalization, on how to get out of an impasse, on the relation between sexual desire and power in the analytic relationship, on patients who seem to want to sabotage their treatments, on flying blind as an analyst, and on a number of other intriguing, important practical topics. Renik's down-to-earth presentation and discussion of clinical anecdotes, combined with useful recommendations for both analyst and patient, amounts to a clear and readable how-to manual. The book is intended for all mental health caregivers, patients and potential patients, and for anyone who is curious about what makes for effective, helpful psychotherapy.</p><p><b>Owen Renik, M.D.</b><br><br>Owen Renik, M.D., is currently a Training and Supervising Analyst at the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Society. He was Editor in Chief of <i>The Psychoanalytic Quarterly</i> for ten years, Program Chair of The American Psychoanalytic Association for two terms, and served as Director of Training and Associate Chief of the Department of Psychiatry at Mount Zion Hospital, San Francisco. He maintains a private practice in San Francisco.<b>Foreword Magazine <br></b><br>This couchbuster could be the tipping point for a second Freudian revolution....<br><br>The author, a psychiatrist and respected teaching analyst in San Francisco and editor of <i>The Psychoanalytic Quarterly</i> for a decade, has the credentials to make his practical, humane approach credible to his colleagues. He distills his professional and personal experience with a comfortable balance of assurance and humility. Patients will love it, progressive analysts will embrace him, conservatives will distance themselves. <br><br>This book should shake up the Freudian establishment, as it empowers patients and their advocates. Historians of psychoanalysis will hear echoes of Otto Rank, Harry Stack Sullivan, Clara Thompson, Carl Rogers, Rollo May, and Irvin Yalom. Here they come home to roost, if not to crow. It takes an Owen Renik to do this, as it took Richard Nixon to open the door to China where others could only wait, or knock in frustration. The ghost of Sigmund Freud will probably nod his approval.<br><b>PsycCritiques </b><br><br>Owen Renik's slim volume, Practical Psychoanalysis for Therapists and Patients, is written in jargon-free, straightforward language that ensures its accessibility to both patients and therapists. In the jacket notes, Allen Wheelis describes Renik as &#x201c;a new broom in the littered corridors of psychoanalysis.&#x201d;<br><br>...Sometimes a broom is just a broom. In this case, however, Renik's broom sweeps away some of the accumulated cobwebs that have obscured the brilliance of Freud's invention, psychoanalysis. Writing, as he does, from the pinnacle of a career devoted to psychoanalytic practice and scholarship, Owen Renik's call for mutual engagement, humility, and a bit of practicality is welcome.</p><h2>Saunders Nursing Guide to Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests (NURSE&#39;S MANUAL OF LABORATORY TESTS AND DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES)</h2><p>ï¿½ This complete lab book contains the latest information on testing organized alphabetically for quick reference. <br>ï¿½ It has student-friendly features that provide great information for practicing nurses. <br>ï¿½ "Significance of Test Results" sections list the diseases and disorders that are associated with abnormal findings, and Test Result Indications sections list the possible clinical significance of abnormal findings. <br>ï¿½ Tests are presented in a format that emphasizes the nurse's role, and includes Basics the Nurse Needs to Know and Nursing Care. <br>ï¿½ The clinical purpose of each test is identified, and how each test is performed is clearly explained. <br>ï¿½ A pronunciation guide for the name of each test helps with difficult terminology<ul><li>A focus on nursing explains how lab tests are used in nursing care.</li><li>Alphabetical organization makes every test easy to find.</li><li>Pronunciation guides for test names help students with difficult terminology.</li><li>"Purpose of the Test" sections identify the indications of each test.</li><li>"Basics the Nurse Needs to Know" offers an explanation of each test in clear, simple language.</li><li>Normal Values in standard and SI units include variations for gender and age, where relevant.</li><li>Critical Values are highlighted with the Normal Values, where relevant.</li><li>"How the Test is Done" sections succinctly describe how each test is performed.</li><li>"Significance of Test Results" sections list the diseases and disorders that are associated with abnormal findings.</li><li>"Interfering Factors" sections list of the factors&#x2015;such as drugs, herbs, and improper specimen collection and handling&#x2015;that inadvertently affect test results.</li><li>"Nursing Care" sections explain what the nurse is to do pretest, during the test, and posttest, and highlights nursing responses to critical values and complications, patient teaching, and health promotion.</li><li>"Health Promotion" information is highlighted where relevant, noting the use of a test for screening asymptomatic individuals, with a testing schedule or other indication for when the test should be performed.</li><li>Patient Teaching information is highlighted to make this crucial nursing content easy to find.</li><li>Nursing Responses to Critical Values and Complications note what the nurse should be alert for during and after the test and how to manage dangerous situations.</li><li>Appendix D: Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests for Frequently Occurring Medical Diagnoses lists the tests used most often for various disorders, and is a handy guide for students using lab tests in clinicals, as well as for practicing nurses.</li><li>Appendix E: Tests by Body System with Test Purpose lists all tests with page number of the main entry, along with the purpose of each test for quick reference.</li><li>The new JCAHO guidelines for abbreviations are followed to reduce errors in laboratory readings.</li></ul></p><p>Louise M.

This book builds the electromagnetic model using an axiomatic approach in steps: first for static electric fields, then for static magnetic fields, and finally for time-varying fields leading to Maxwell's equations. This approach results in an organized and systematic development of the subject matter. Applications of derived relations to fundamental phenomena and electromagnetic technologies are explained.</p> <p> <b>Back Cover</b> </p> <p> <b>Field and Wave Electromagnetics, Second Edition</b> features many examples of practical applications to give students an excellent physical -- as well as mathematical -- understanding of important concepts. These include applications drawn from important new areas of technology such as optical fibers, radome design, satellite communication, and microstrip lines. There is also added coverage of several new topics, including Hall effect, radar equation and scattering cross section, transients in transmission lines, waveguides and circular cavity resonators, wave propagation in the ionosphere, and helical antennas. New exercises, new problems, and many worked-out examples make this complex material more accessible to students.</p><blockquote> <p>The many books on introductory electromagnetics can be roughly divided into two main groups. The first group takes the traditional development: starting with the experimental laws, generalizing them in steps, and finally synthesizing them in the form of Maxwell's equations. This is an inductive approach. The second group takes the axiomatic development: starting with Maxwell's equations, identifying each with the appropriate experimental law, and specializing the general equations to static and time-varying situations for analysis. This is a deductive approach. A few books begin with a treatment of the special theory of relativity and develop all of electromagnetic theory from Coulomb's law of force; but this approach requires the discussion and understanding of the special theory of relativity first and is perhaps best suited for a course at an advanced level. </p> <p>Proponents of the traditional development argue that it is the way electromagnetic theory was unraveled historically (from special experimental laws to Maxwell's equations), and that it is easier for the students to follow than the other methods. I feel, however, that the way a body of knowledge was unraveled is not necessarily the best way to teach the subject to students. The topics tend to be fragmented and cannot take full advantage of the conciseness of vector calculus. Students are puzzled at, and often form a mental block to, the subsequent introduction of gradient, divergence, and curl operations. As a process for formulating an electromagnetic model, this approach lacks cohesiveness and elegance. </p> <p>The axiomatic development usually begins with the set of four Maxwell's equations, either in differential or in integral from, as fundamental postulates. These are equations of considerable complexity and are difficult to master. They are likely to cause consternation and resistance in students who are hit with all of them at the beginning of a book. Alert students will wonder about the meaning of the field vectors and about the necessity and sufficiency of these general equations. At the final stage students tend to be confused about the concepts of the electromagnetic model, and they are not yet comfortable with the associated mathematical manipulations. In any case, the general Maxwell's equations are soon simplified to apply to static fields, which allow the consideration of electrostatic fields and magnetostatic fields separately. Why then should the entire set of four Maxwell's equations be introduced at the outset? </p> <p>It may be argued that Coulomb's law, though based on experimental evidence, is in fact also a postulate. Consider the two stipulations of Coulomb's law: that the charged bodies are very small compared with their distance of separation, and that the force between the charged bodies is inversely proportional to the square of their distance. The question arises regarding the first stipulation: How small must the charged bodies be in order to be considered "very small" compared with their distance? In practice the charged bodies cannot be of vanishing sizes (ideal point charges), and there is difficulty in determining the "true" distance between two bodies of finite dimensions. For given body sizes the relative accuracy in distance measurements is better when the separation is larger. However, practical considerations (weakness of force, existence of extraneous charged bodies, etc.) restrict the usable distance of separation in the laboratory, and experimental inaccuracies cannot be entirely avoided. This leads to a more important question concerning the inverse-square relation of the second stipulation. Even if the charged bodies were of vanishing sizes, experimental measurements could not be of an infinite accuracy no matte how skillful and careful an experimenter was. How then was it possible for Coulomb to know that the force was exactly inversely proportional to the square (not the 2.000001th or the 1.999999th power) of the distance of separation? This question cannot be answered from an experimental viewpoint because it is not likely that during Coulomb's time experiments could have been accurate to the seventh place. We must therefore conclude that Coulomb's law is itself a postulate and that it is a law of nature discovered and assumed on the basis of his experiments of a limited accuracy (see Section 3.2). </p> <p>This book builds the electromagnetic model using an axiomatic approach in steps: first for static electric fields (Chapter 3), then for static magnetic fields (Chapter 6), and finally for time-varying fields leading to Maxwell's equations (Chapter 7). The mathematical basis for each step is Helmholtz's theorem, which states that a vector field is determined to within an additive constant if both its divergence and its curl are specified everywhere. Thus, for the development of the electrostatic model in free space, it is only necessary to define a single vector (namely, the electric field intensity E) by specifying its divergence and its curl as postulates. All other relations in electrostatics for free space, including Coulomb's law and Gauss's law, can be derived from the two rather simple postulates. Relations in materials media can be developed through the concept of equivalent charge distributions of polarized dielectrics. </p> <p>Similarly, for the magnetostatic model in free space it is necessary to define only a single magnetic flux density vector B by specifying its divergence and its curl as postulates; all other formulas can be derived from these two postulates. Relations in material media can be developed through the concept of equivalent current densities. Of course, the validity of the postulates lies in their ability to yield results that conform with experimental evidence. </p> <p>For time-varying fields, the electric and magnetic field intensities are coupled. The curl E postulate for the electrostatic model must be modified to conform with Faraday's law. In addition, the curl B postulate for the mangetostatic model must also be modified in order to be consistent with the equation of continuity. We have, then, the four Maxwell's equations that constitute the electromagnetic model. I believe that this gradual development of the electromagnetic model based on Helmholtz's theorem is novel, systematic, pedagogically sound, and more easily accepted by students. </p> <p>In the presentation of the material, I strive for lucidity and unity, and for smooth and logical flow of ideas. Many worked-out examples are included to emphasize fundamental concepts and to illustrate methods for solving typical problems. Applications of derived relations to useful technologies (such as ink-jet printers, lightning arresters, electret microphones, cable design, multiconductor systems, electrostatic shielding, Doppler radar, random design, Polaroid filters, satellite communication systems, optical fibers, and microstrip lines) are discussed. Review questions appear at the end of each chapter to test the students' retention and understanding of the essential material in the chapter. The problems in each chapter are designed to reinforce sturdents' comprehension of the interrelationships between the different quantities in the formulas, and to extend their ability of applying the formulas to solve practical problems. In teaching, I have found the review questions a particularly useful device to stimulate students' interest and to keep them alert in class. </p> <p>Besides the fundamentals of electromagnetic fields, this book also covers the theory and applications of transmission lines, waveguides, and cavity resonators, and antennas and radiating systems. The fundamental concepts and the governing theory of electromagnetism do not change with the introduction of new electromagnetic devices. Ample reasons and incentives for learning the fundamental principles of electromagnetic are given in Section 1.1. I hope that the contents of this book, strengthened by the novel approach, will provide students with a secure and sufficient background for understanding and analyzing basic electromagnetic phenomena as well as prepare them for more advanced subjects in electromagnetic theory. </p> <p>There is enough material in this book for a two-semester sequence of courses. Chapters 1 through 7 contain the material on fields, and Chapters 8 through 11 on waves and applications. In schools where there is only a one-semester course on electromagnetics, Chapters 1 through 7, plus the first four sections of Chapter 8 would provide a good foundation on fields and an introduction of waves in unbounded media. The remaining material would serve as a useful reference boon on applications or as a textbook for a follow-up elective course. Schools on a quarter system could adjust the material to be covered in accordance with the total number of hours assigned to the subject of electromagnetics. Of course, individual instructors have the prerogative to emphasize and expand certain topics, and to deemphasize or delete certain others. </p> <p>I have given considerable thought to the advisability of including computer programs for the solution of some problems, but have finally decided against it. diverting students' attention and effort tot numerical methods and computer software would distract them from concentrating on learning the fundamentals of electromagnetism. Where appropriate, the dependence of important results on the value of a parameter is stressed by curves; field distributions and antenna patterns are illustrated by graphs; and typical mode patters in waveguides are plotted. The computer programs for obtaining these curves, graphs, and mode patterns are not always simple. Students in science and engineering are required to acquire a facility of using computers; but the inclusion of some cookbook-style computer programs in a book on the fundamental principles of electromagnetic fields and waves would appear to contribute little to the understanding of the subject matter. </p> <p>This book was first published in 1983. Favorable reactions and friendly encouragement from professors and students have provided me with the impetus to come out with a new edition. In this second edition I have added many new topics. These include Hall effect, d-c motors, transformers, eddy current, energy-transport velocity for wide-band signals in waveguides, radar equation and scattering cross section, transients in transmission lines, Bessel functions, circular waveguides and circular cavity resonators, waveguide discontinuities, wave propagation in ionosphere and newer earth's surface, helical antennas, log-periodic dipole arrays, and antenna effective length and effective area. The total number of problems has been expanded by about 35 percent. </p> <p>The Addison-Wesley Publishing Company has decided to make this second edition a two-color book. I think the readers will agree that the book is handsomely produced. I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to all the people on the editorial, production, and marketing staff who provided help in bringing out this new edition. In particular, I wish to thank Thomas Robbins, Barbara Rifkind, Karen Myer, Joseph K. Vetere, and Katherine Harutunian. </p> </blockquote></p><h2>Strategies for Teaching Students with Learning and Behavior Problems, Loose-Leaf Version (9th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b>Note: This is the loose-leaf version of</b> <b> <i>Strategies for Teaching Students with Learning and Behavior Problems </i> </b> <b>and does not include access to the Enhanced Pearson eText.

For the first time, medical men mapped diseases to understand and prevent epidemics, natural scientists mapped climate and rainfall to uncover weather patterns, educators mapped the past to foster national loyalty among students, and Northerners mapped slavery to assess the power of the South. After the Civil War, federal agencies embraced statistical and thematic mapping in order to profile the ethnic, racial, economic, moral, and physical attributes of a reunified nation. By the end of the century, Congress had authorized a national archive of maps, an explicit recognition that old maps were not relics to be discarded but unique records of the nation&#x2019;s past.</p> <p>All of these experiments involved the realization that maps were not just illustrations of data, but visual tools that were uniquely equipped to convey complex ideas and information. In <i>Mapping the Nation</i>, Susan Schulten charts how maps of epidemic disease, slavery, census statistics, the environment, and the past demonstrated the analytical potential of cartography, and in the process transformed the very meaning of a map.</p> <p>Today, statistical and thematic maps are so ubiquitous that we take for granted that data will be arranged cartographically. Whether for urban planning, public health, marketing, or political strategy, maps have become everyday tools of social organization, governance, and economics. The world we inhabit&#x2014;saturated with maps and graphic information&#x2014;grew out of this sea change in spatial thought and representation in the nineteenth century, when Americans learned to see themselves and their nation in new dimensions.</p> <p></p></p><p><p><b>Susan Schulten</b> is professor of history at the University of Denver. In 2010 she was named a fellow of the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation.</p>"In this innovative book Susan Schulten makes a compelling case for maps&nbsp;as both symbolic and material representations of change in the ways Americans&nbsp;viewed their nation, its past, and its potential for development.

A compelling adventure story, it is also a novel of profound psychological insight and of powerful political implications. It tells the story of a Central American state whose silver mine serves both literally and metaphorically as the source of the country&#x2018;s value. Written at the time of the development of the Panama Canal, <em>Nostromo</em> is set in the imaginary province of Sulaco, which secedes from the federation of Costaguana in order to protect its natural resource, the silver mine. The parallels with the &#x2018;revolution&#x2019; fomented in Panama by the United States in 1903 are striking; just as Panama seceded from Columbia to satisfy the material interests of the canal builders, so the secession of Sulaco serves the material interests of &#x2018;the Gould concession.&#x2019; In this edition a variety of documents from the period (including material concerning American involvement in Central America in the early twentieth century, early critical notices, and family letters of Conrad&#x2019;s) help to set the text in context. </p></p><h2>Tom Brown&#39;s Schooldays (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>One of the classics of English children's literature, and one of the earliest books written specifically for boys, this novel's steady popularity has given it an influence well beyond the upper middle-class world that it describes.

Stanley defines&nbsp;anger as&nbsp;"a strong feeling of intense displeasure, hostility, or indignation as a result of a real or an imagined threat or insult, frustration, or injustice toward yourself or towards someone who&#x2019;s very important to you." Building on this defintion, Stanley...<br><br>1. Helps readers identify the signs of anger, so they can identify anger in themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>2.

Walks readers through the steps to true forgiveness and the healing power it brings.<br><br>With compassion and a wealth of biblical understanding, Stanley explains that the measure of a person is "the size of thing that makes them angry." He goes on to distinguish between healthy and harmful anger and reminds us that "righteous indignation" is a divine emotion. However, he skillfully explains that misguided anger eats away at ourselves, our relationships with others, and our relationship with God.&nbsp;By helping readers&nbsp;look honestly at the source of their anger, he&nbsp;gently leads them to&nbsp;the ability to truly forgive and find the peace they seek.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Charles F.

This book offers a fresh approach to the negotiation of death and grief. It is founded in principles of constructive conversation that focus on "remembering" lives, in contrast to processes of forgetting or dismembering those who have died. Re-membering is about a comforting, life enhancing, and sustaining approach to death that does not dwell on the pain of loss and is much more than wistful reminiscing. It is about the deliberate construction of stories that continue to include the dead in the membership of our lives.</p></p><p>"This book is a gift. It reconstructs the realities of death and grief in such a way that we are lifted up. With conceptual sophistication, clarity of voice, and an ear for good stories, the authors teach us about the importance of narrative in keeping those who have passed on alive and well in our daily lives. An inspiring work." &#x2014;Ken Gergen, Ph.D., author, An Invitation to Social Construction <p>"Compassionate and conceptually sophisticated, Re-membering Lives transcends the constraints of traditional grief theories with their emphasis on &#x2018;letting go,&#x2019; offering instead conversational practices for &#x2018;holding on&#x2019; to those we have loved and lost. I recommend this book highly both to the bereaved and to those professionals who wish to assist them in cultivating continued connection to the sustaining relationships that give life its meaning. "Animated by a narrative emphasis on the storied nature of human life, Hedtke and Winslade open new vistas for continuing the life stories of those we love beyond their deaths. This practical and compassionate volume has a place on the shelf of every counselor and therapist who wants to help the dying and bereaved affirm their continuing bonds in the face of life&#x2019;s ultimate transitions. </p><p>"By clearly articulating the healing power of remembering practices, and anchoring their recommendations in evocative case vignettes, Hedtke and Winslade provide a new perspective on the challenges and possibilities of bereavement that is both revolutionary and readable. This book draws inspiration from the narrative and meaning-making approaches that are transforming the filed of grief therapy, while at the same time sharpening its practical implications. "Compact and compassionate, this book will help both the bereaved and the secular or spiritual counselors they consult affirm sustaining attachments even in the face of death. The conversational practices offered by these authors extend the life legacies of those we have loved and lost, and have a place in the work of every grief therapist." &#x2014;Robert A. Neimeyer, Ph.D. Editor, Death Studies author, Meaning Reconstruction and the Experience of Loss </p><p>"This volume in the Death, Value and Meaning Series offers an "out of the box" philosophy for healthcare professionals in the end-of-life care provision. Based upon the concepts of remembering and constructive conversations, this book provides an alternative, sometimes radical, departure from the traditional grief and bereavement theories. </p><p>Through a series of stories and vignettes, the book engages the reader, while providing interactive opportunities to contribute stories of their own to this ongoing research. The book is innovative and disturbing at this same time&#x2014;interesting reading. </p><p>Mental health clinicians, family therapists, caseworkers, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, physicians, nurses, bereavement counselors, hospice and palliative care professionals&#x2014;all will find this an excellent resource for alternative grief therapies." &#x2014;Becky Stepp, BBA, MEd, BS, M(Seton Medical Center), Doody Enterprises Online Review </p><p>". . . for me this is a good book to be re-reading, to return to, and to continue gaining from, as I apply its wisdom in my practice. The ideas here lead on to further thought and discussion too in many areas, such as the application of narrative methods to non-death griefs, and to relationship endings in all their infinite varieties. </p><p>I think this book is a valuable addition to the written and spoken material on grief, and it would have appeal and application for many of those of us who either grieve, or support those who grieve. It sits well alongside any professional practice modalities which are concerned with: person-centered work, meaning making, strengths-based work, reframing, empowering, honoring lives and relationships, and much more. Overall its message provides a remarkably positive and hopeful approach to grief work in all its aspects." &#x2014;Anne Horrill, New Zealand Association of Counsellors Newsletter, September, 2004 </p><p>"Hedtke and Winslade emphasize the importance of remembering our dead by speaking of them ften and so allowing them to live on, rather than to remain silently hidden away within the grieving individual. This book proposes linking rather then severing, connecting rather than disconnecting, and that this can and should be done before we die. It shows how we can embrace the dying and the bereaved in the membership club of the living. The book is critical of any grief therapy and bereavement counseling that suggests 'letting go of the dead' and 'getting on with life', where this means forgetting the dead or discouraging continuing bonds with the dead." &#x2014;Josefine Speyer, Natural Death Centre News &amp; Views Autumn/Winter 2004</p>Lorraine Hedtke, MSW, ACSW, CISW, has been in private practice since 1986 and is on the faculty of The Institute for Creative Change, in Phoenix, Arizona, a professional think tank and learning community that fosters social constructionist thinking.

Why do the Dogon of Africa and the civilizations of ancient Egypt, India, Tibet, and China share sacred words and symbols? Revealing the existence of a long-forgotten primal culture and the world&#x2019;s first center of higher learning, Laird Scranton shows how the sophisticated complex at Gobekli Tepe in Turkey is the definitive point of origin from which all the great civilizations of the past inherited their cosmology, esoteric teachings, and civilizing skills, such as agriculture, metallurgy, and stone masonry, fully developed. <br><br>Scranton explains how the carved images on Gobekli Tepe&#x2019;s stone pillars were the precursors to the sacred symbols of the Dogon, Egyptians, Tibetans, and Chinese as well as the matriarchal Sakti cult of ancient Iran and India. He identifies Gobekli Tepe as a remote mountain sanctuary of higher knowledge alluded to in Sakti myth, named like an important temple in Egypt, and defined in ancient Buddhist tradition as Vulture Peak. Scranton reveals how Gobekli Tepe&#x2019;s enigmatic &#x201c;H&#x201d; carvings and animal symbolism, symbolic of stages of creation, was presented as a kind of prototype of written language accessible to the hunter-gathers who inhabited the region. He shows how the myths and deities of many ancient cultures are connected linguistically, extending even to the name of Gobekli Tepe and the Egyptian concept of <i>Zep Tepi</i>, the mythical age of the &#x201c;First Time.&#x201d; <br><br>Identifying Gobekli Tepe not only as the first university but also as the first temple, perhaps built as a civilizing exercise, Scranton definitively places this enigmatic archaeological site at the point of origin of civilization, religion, and ancient science.</p><p>Laird Scranton is a recognized authority on Dogon mythology and symbolism.

Working with avant-garde playwrights, actors, and producers in a new political environment, artists such as Marc Chagall, Natan Altman, Robert Falk, and Aleksandr Tyshler combined Russian folk art with elements of Cubo-Futurism and Constructivism into a bold new style. This collaboration gave rise to extraordinary productions with highly original stage designs that redefined the concept of theater itself.</p><p>From the Jewish mythical and folkloric plays produced at Habima to the daring, expressionistic Yiddish dramas presented at the Moscow State Yiddish Theater (GOSET), this beautifully illustrated book chronicles the flourishing of Soviet Jewish theater in the 1920s and 1930s.

He is author of the best-selling <em>Colloquial Dutch</em>.</p><h2>The Isles: A History</h2><p>Written by one of the most brilliant and provocative historians at work today, <em>The Isles</em> is a revolutionary narrative history that presents a new perspective on the development of Britain and Ireland, looking at them not as self-contained islands, but as an inextricable part of Europe.<br> This richly layered history begins with the Celtic Supremacy in the last centuries BC, which is presented in the light of a Celtic world stretching all the way from Iberia to Asia Minor. Roman Britain is seen not as a unique phenomenon but as similar to the other frontier regions of the Roman Empire. The Viking Age is viewed not only through the eyes of the invaded but from the standpoint of the invaders themselves--Norse, Danes, and Normans. In the later chapters, Davies follows the growth of the United Kingdom and charts the rise and fall of the main pillars of 'Britishness'--the Royal Navy, the Westminster Parliament, the Constitutional Monarchy, the Aristocracy, the British Empire, and the English Language.<br> This holistic approach challenges the traditional nationalist picture of a thousand years of "eternal England"--a unique country formed at an early date by Anglo-Saxon kings which evolved in isolation and, except for the Norman Conquest, was only marginally affected by continental affairs. The result is a new picture of the Isles, one of four countries--England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales--constantly buffeted by continental storms and repeatedly transformed by them.<br></p><p>When did British history begin, and where will it all end? These controversial issues are tackled head-on in Norman Davies's polemical and persuasive survey of the four countries that in modern times have become known as the British Isles. Covering 10 millennia in just over a thousand pages, from "Cheddar Man" to New Labour, Davies shows how relatively recently the English state was formed--no earlier than Tudor times--and shows, too, how a sense of Britishness emerged only with the coming of empire in the 18th and 19th centuries. A historian of Poland, and the author of an acclaimed history of Europe, Davies is especially sensitive to the complex mixing and merging of tribes and races, languages and traditions, conquerors and colonized that has gone on throughout British history and that in many ways makes "our island story" much more like that of the rest of Europe than we usually think. Many myths of the English are dispelled in this book, and many historians are taken to task for their blinkered Anglocentrism. But the book ends on an upbeat note, with Davies welcoming Britain's return to the heart of Europe at the dawn of the new millennium. <i>--Miles Taylor, Amazon.co.uk</i><br><strong>Norman Davies</strong> is the author of <em>Europe: A History</em>.

Along with Wernher von Braun, Heisenberg's career under Hitler represents perhaps the best twentieth-century example of a faustian bargain with evil for the advancement of knowledge and science. Cassidy tells this story with nuance and passion.&#x201d;&#x2014;Mark Walker, author of <i>Nazi Science: Myth, Truth, and the German Atomic Bomb</i></p><p>In 1992, David C. Cassidy&#x2019;s groundbreaking biography of Werner Heisenberg, <i>Uncertainty</i>, was published to resounding acclaim from scholars and critics. Michael Frayn, in the <i>Playbill </i>of the Broadway production of <i>Copenhagen</i>, referred to it as one of his main sources and &#x201c;the standard work in English.&#x201d; Richard Rhodes (<i>The Making of the Atom Bomb</i>) called it &#x201c;the definitive biography of a great and tragic physicist,&#x201d; and the <i>Los Angeles Times </i>praised it as &#x201c;an important book. Cassidy has sifted the record and brilliantly detailed Heisenberg&#x2019;s actions.&#x201d; No book that has appeared since has rivaled <i>Uncertainty</i>, now out of print, for its depth and rich detail of the life, times, and science of this brilliant and controversial figure of twentieth-century physics.</p><p>Since the fall of the Soviet Union, long-suppressed information has emerged on Heisenberg&#x2019;s role in the Nazi atomic bomb project. In <i>Beyond Uncertainty</i>, Cassidy interprets this and other previously unknown material within the context of his vast research and tackles the vexing questions of a scientist&#x2019;s personal responsibility and guilt when serving an abhorrent military regime.</p><p><b>David C.

He shows how the written word originated, how it spread, and how it figured in the evolution of civilization. Using as his center the role of printing in making the written way of thinking dominant, Martin examines the interactions of individuals and cultures to produce new forms of "writing" in the many senses of authorship, language rendition, and script.<br> <br> Martin looks at how much the development of writing owed to practical necessity, and how much to religious and social systems of symbols. He describes the precursors to writing and reveals their place in early civilization as mnemonic devices in service of the spoken word. The tenacity of the oral tradition plays a surprisingly important part in this story, Martin notes, and even as late as the eighteenth century educated individuals were trained in classical rhetoric and preferred to rely on the arts of memory. Finally, Martin discusses the changes to writing wrought by the electronic revolution, offering invaluable insights into the influence these new technologies have had on children born into the computer age.</p></p><p><b>Lydia G.

A highlight is her quintessential '70s love affair with a naï¿½ve porn star; together they hobnobbed around Europe in search of great food and wine.

He discusses the plight of endangered languages, as well as successful cases of linguistic revitalization. Much more than a history, Crystal&#x2019;s work looks forward to the future of language, exploring the effect of technology on our day-to-day reading, writing, and speech.

Thompson, a pilot active in the X-15 program from beginning to end, tells the dramatic story of one of the most successful research aircraft ever flown.</p><p><b>Milton O. Thompson</b> (1926-1993) was chief engineer at the NASA Ames-Dryden Flight Research Facility in Edwards, California.Initiated in the 1950s, the X-15 program tested a unique rocket-powered aircraft at supersonic speeds in the atmosphere's outer limits. The stubby-winged, needle-nosed craft achieved speeds of 4000 mph, could fly at altitudes of well over 200,000 feet and yielded data crucial to NASA's space missions. Thomson, one of the test pilots, traces the technical developments of the program, emphasizing the viewpoint of the men who (barely) controlled the unpredictable plane in the air. He demonstrates through a series of vivid anecdotes the effect of g forces, extreme vertigo and other mental and physical problems associated with supersonic flight. Thompson includes accounts of hair-raising emergency rescues and a somber description of the death of one of his colleagues during a 1967 test flight. Retired in 1968 along with the program itself, the X-15 now hangs in the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. Surprisingly, it is still the world's fastest airplane. Thompson's well-written history of the program captures the technical challenges, the camaraderie and, most of all, the high adventure of X-15 flight. Highly recommended.

Former Assistant Deputy Secretary of State Ronald Asmus contends that it was a conflict that was prepared and planned for some time by Moscow, part of a broader strategy to send a message to the United States: that Russia is going to flex its muscle in the twenty-first century. <i>A Little War that Shook the World </i>is a fascinating look at the breakdown of relations between Russia and the West, the decay and decline of the Western Alliance itself, and the fate of Eastern Europe in a time of economic crisis.</p></p><p><p><b>Ronald Asmus</b> is executive director of the Brussels-based Transatlantic Center and responsible for Strategic Planning at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. He is the former deputy assistant secretary of state for European Affairs during President Clinton's second term. He has published numerous essays over the years on US-European relations, including in <i>Foreign Affairs, Survival, the American Interest </i>and<i> Policy Review</i>. He is the author of <i>Opening Nato's Door</i>, a contributor to <i>The Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, </i>and <i>The</i> <i>New Republic, </i>and others, and is a commentator in both the American and European news media.

An explorer experiences life on the moon, in a story written six decades before the first moon landing... Electrical appliances respond to human anxieties and threaten to crash the electrical grid...

You&#39;ll learn about the central objects and theorems of mathematics, including graphs, calculus, linear algebra, eigenvalues, optimization, and more. You&#39;ll also be immersed in the often unspoken cultural attitudes of mathematics, learning both how to read and write proofs while understanding why mathematics is the way it is. Between each technical chapter is an essay describing a different aspect of mathematical culture, and discussions of the insights and meta-insights that constitute mathematical intuition. As you learn, we&#39;ll use new mathematical ideas to create wondrous programs, from cryptographic schemes to neural networks to hyperbolic tessellations. Each chapter also contains a set of exercises that have you actively explore mathematical topics on your own. In short, this book will teach you to engage with mathematics.

They convince us once again of what we may have forgotten: that we need to create schools that constantly demonstrate a belief in their students.</p><p>Written by Theodore and Nancy Sizer, coprincipals of a high school and veterans in the field of education (he was named dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education at age 32, she trains teachers in the same program), <i>The Students Are Watching</i> is a gentle but tough-minded plea for resetting the moral compass of American education and creating academic institutions "which will nurture our humanity." In high schools, which the authors call "one of America's most ubiquitous intentional communities," teachers and administrations can choose to model values they believe in, or they can slip into the same lazy strategies used by their students to avoid work and responsibility. "They watch us all the time," warn the Sizers, who believe in the profound power of the school system to change children's lives, and offer a wealth of ideas for educators and other adults to create the culture of trust and respect that will change their charges for the better. <i>--Maria Dolan</i><b>Theodore Sizer&nbsp;</b>(1932-2009) and&nbsp;<b>Nancy Sizer</b>&nbsp;were coprincipals of the Parker Charter High School.

His iconic images of Bogart, Hemingway, Churchill, the Kennedys, Auden, Castro, Einstein, the Clintons, Khrushchev, Casals, and Elizabeth II inhabit the mind's eye of anyone familiar with photographic history. A refugee from the ethnic cleansing of Turkish Armenians in 1916, Karsh made his home in Boston and Ottawa but travelled the globe during his sixty-year career, photographing political leaders, celebrities, monarchs, and movie stars. He died in 2002, aged 94. He left a legacy of 50,000 portraits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is the first biography, written with help from his family and colleagues and based on the Karsh archive in Ottawa. Its publication marks Karsh's centenary in 2008, when retrospective exhibitions are scheduled in a number of locations in North America, including the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Art Institute of Chicago, Boston Public Library, and Rhode Island School of Design. The book reproduces sixty of Karsh&#x2019;s most celebrated portraits, and reveals the technique behind the camera and the brilliant mastery of the photographer.</p></p><p><p>Maria Tippett is a cultural historian now living in British Columbia.

But on the eve of World War II, the obsessed characters in this mesmerizing novel find that their pursuits lead only to bedrooms in which each seeks to know-and possess-the other.</p><p><b>Lawrence Durrell </b>was born in 1912 in India. He attended the Jesuit College at Darjeeling and St. Edmund's School, Canterbury. His first literary work, <i>The Black Book</i>, appeared in Paris in 1938. His first collection of poems, <i>A Private Country</i>, was published in 1943, followed by the three Island books: <i>Prospero's Cell</i>; <i>Reflections on a Marine Venus</i>, about Rhodes; and <i>Bitter Lemons</i>, his account of life in Cyprus. Durrell's wartime sojourn in Egypt led to his masterpiece, <i>The Alexandria Quartet</i>, which he completed in southern France, where he settled permanently in 1957. Between the quartet and <i>The Avignon Quintet</i> he wrote the two-decker <i>Tunc </i>and <i>Nunquam</i>. His oeuvre includes plays, a book of criticism, translations, travel writing, and humorous stories about the diplomatic corps. <i>Caesar's Vast Ghost</i>, his reflections on the history and culture of Provence, including a late flowering of poems, was published a few days before his death in Sommiï¿½res in 1990.<br><br><b>Robert Ryan</b>&nbsp;has written and illustrated several books including: <i>Justine</i>, <i>This Is For You</i>, and <i>A Sky Full Of Kindness</i>. Ryan was born in 1962 in Akrotiri, Cyprus. He studied fine art at Trent Polytechnic before he went on to specialize in printmaking at the Royal College of Art in London. In addition to fine art, he works in the mediums of ceramics, textiles, homewares, and jewelry. His work has been exhibited widely across the UK and internationally. He lives and works in London.[Editor's Note: The following is a combined review with BALTHAZAR, MOUNTOLIVE, and CLEA.]--The four linked novels that comprise English author Lawrence Durrell's masterpiece, THE ALEXANDRIA QUARTET, are set in Alexandria, Egypt, around the time of WWII. The four novels explore the city's polyglot society, full of intrigue, mystery, and sensuality, telling essentially the same story from different points of view. JUSTINE focuses on the beautiful Jewish wife of a wealthy Copt. Her story is told by Darley, her English lover. In BALTHAZAR, Darley reconsiders and retells the story he told in Justine, using information from a mysterious new character, Balthazar. In MOUNTOLIVE, as war begins to loom, British Ambassador David Mountolive enters the intrigues of the interwoven community of characters. In CLEA, Darley returns to a war-fevered Alexandria as the stories of the many characters move toward conclusion. Narrator Nigel Anthony provides a brilliant reading, keeping the variety of voices--English, French, Egyptian--distinct throughout. He offers a one-man play, conveying the passions, disappointments, and triumphs of the complex cast. The classical music interludes that delineate sections of this beautifully produced and packaged set help transport the listener to back- streets of Alexandria. R.E.K.

Relying heavily on quotations from diaries, letters, and interviews, garnered through extensive research, Dwork de scribes daily living as seen through the eyes of children. She plumbs the sorrows of parents desperately trying to save their children by placing them with foster Christian families through various formal and informal networks that operated throughout Europe. And she chronicles the pitiful attempts to cling to some semblance of normalcy amidst the inhuman, bizarre conditions in the ghettos and the concentration camps. Only ten percent of Jewish children survived the Nazi onslaught. Dwork's powerful book gives new meaning to this numbing statistic.<br><i>-Carol R. Glatt, VA Medical Ctr. Lib., Philadelphia</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.The Nazis' murder of 1.5 million Jewish children is the focus of this pioneering study. Expelled from school, forced to wear the yellow star, Jewish children in German-occupied Europe had their family lives shattered by anti-Semitic legislation prior to the outbreak of war. Later some hid in attics or forests; others concealed their identities but remained visible, constantly threatened by starvation, disease or selection for the gas chambers. Yet, Yale scholar Dwork demonstrates, Jewish children created their own mental space, where play, love and relationships continued amid the evil and horror. Tapping letters, diaries, drawings and oral histories of survivors, Dwork adds a poignant new dimension to Holocaust studies. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Certified Paralegal Review Manual: A Practical Guide to CP Exam Preparation (Test Preparation)</h2><p>Like the exam itself, this comprehensive manual is known in the field for high standards of paralegal professionalism and excellence.

But that&#x2019;s easier said than done. Here Pema Chï¿½drï¿½n introduces a powerful, transformative method to nurture these qualities using a practice called <i>lojong</i>, which has been a primary focus of her teachings and personal practice for many years. And for centuries, Tibetan Buddhists have relied on these teachings to awaken the deep goodness that lies within us.<br><br>The <i>lojong </i>teachings include fifty-nine pithy slogans for daily contemplation, such as &#x201c;Always maintain only a joyful mind,&#x201d; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be swayed by external circumstances,&#x201d; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t try to be the fastest,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Be grateful to everyone.&#x201d; This book presents each of these slogans and includes Pema&#x2019;s clear, succinct guidance on how to understand them&#x2014;and how they can enrich our lives. It also features a forty-five minute downloadable audio program entitled &#x201c;Opening the Heart,&#x201d; in which Pema offers in-depth instruction on <i>tonglen </i>meditation, a powerful practice that anyone can undertake to awaken compassion for oneself and others.</p><p>PEMA CHï¿½DRï¿½N is an American Buddhist nun in the lineage of renowned Tibetan meditation master Chï¿½gyam Trungpa and resident teacher at Gampo Abbey in Nova Scotia, the first Tibetan monastery in North America established for Westerners.

Starting around 1887, Cajal refined a neurological staining method developed almost 15 years earlier by the Italian histologist Camillo Golgi, and applied it first to relatively orderly parts of the nervous systems like the cerebellum, spinal cord, and retina. The conclusions he drew about the organization of neural circuits were, however, diametrically opposed to those advocated by Golgi, spurring an acrimonious debate that lasted well after the two shared the Nobel Prize in 1906. Early on, Cajal concluded that neural circuits are made up of individual units or nerve cells and interact by way of contact, whereas Golgi believed that such circuits are formed by a reticulum or net of contiguous nerve cells. Cajal was the first to see how neurons interact in the brain, laying the foundation for what came to be known as the neuron doctrine. His second great contribution was the ability to predict the direction of information flow in neural circuits based strictly on morphological criteria: dendrites and soma form the input side of a neuron while the axon forms its output side. This became known as the functional polarity hypothesis.<br><br>Using these two foundation stones, Cajal went on to analyze systematically all parts of the mammalian nervous system, along with selected parts in all classes of vertebrates. A synthesis of that work, this volume, which is accompanied by <strong>over 1,000 original illustrations</strong>, is based almost entirely on personal observation and offers a wealth of factual, historical, and theoretical information.<br></p><p>S.

All rights reserved.In The Time Machine Wells pioneers the concept of travel in the &#39;Fourth Dimension&#39; and speculates about the ultimate decay of the human species. The world of the effete Eloi and ape-like Morlocks, the age of giant crabs, and the final portrayal of the heat-death of the sun constitute an unforgettable vision of the future. The Time Traveller&#39;s narrow escape from the remote descendants of humanity is paralleled by Edward Prendick&#39;s horrifying adventures among the Beast Folk of The Island of Doctor Moreau. Moreau, a ruthless vivisector, chooses an uninhabited Pacific island for his attempts to change animals into human beings on the operating table. Prendick soon fears that he, too, may become a victim of Moreau&#39;s experiments. Even at their most bleakly pessimistic and ironic, these stories testify to the resources of human courage and ingenuity. This edition offers authoritative texts of both novels, explanatory notes, and an introduction setting them in the context of Wells&#39;s life and thought.</p><h2>Making the Social World: The Structure of Human Civilization</h2><p>There are few more important philosophers at work today than John Searle, a creative and contentious thinker who has shaped the way we think about mind and language. Now he offers a profound understanding of how we create a social reality--a reality of money, property, governments, marriages, stock markets and cocktail parties. <br><br>The paradox he addresses in <em>Making the Social World</em> is that these facts only exist because we think they exist and yet they have an objective existence. Continuing a line of investigation begun in his earlier book <em>The Construction of Social Reality</em>, Searle identifies the precise role of language in the creation of all "institutional facts." His aim is to show how mind, language and civilization are natural products of the basic facts of the physical world described by physics, chemistry and biology. Searle explains how a single linguistic operation, repeated over and over, is used to create and maintain the elaborate structures of human social institutions. These institutions serve to create and distribute power relations that are pervasive and often invisible. These power relations motivate human actions in a way that provides the glue that holds human civilization together. <br><br>Searle then applies the account to show how it relates to human rationality, the freedom of the will, the nature of political power and the existence of universal human rights. In the course of his explication, he asks whether robots can have institutions, why the threat of force so often lies behind institutions, and he denies that there can be such a thing as a "state of nature" for language-using human beings.<br></p><p><br><strong>John Searle</strong> is the Slusser Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Language, University of California, Berkeley. His eighteen books include <em>Mind, Speech Acts, Intentionality</em> and <em>The Construction of Social Reality</em>.<br><br>"stimulating and vigorous" --Colin McGinn, <em>New York Review of Books</em> <br><p></p><br>"Searle's latest book is more than recommendable." --<em>Economics and Philosophy</em><p></p><br>"The present [book] may be recommended to newcomers to [Searle's] philosophy as a lively introductory overview of many of his current research themes and of some of his past research achievements." --<em>Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews</em><p></p><br>"wonderfully clear and wonderfully ambitious" --<em>American Journal of Sociology</em><p></p><br>"<em>Making the Social World</em> has no doubt been greatly anticipated by Searle's many colleagues and critics, as his project has generated considerable interest.

First displayed in raw storefront galleries, his work achieved national attention at the same moment that the AIDS epidemic was affecting a generation of artists, himself included.<br> &nbsp;<br> In a thoughtful overview essay, David Breslin looks at the breadth of the artist&#x2019;s work as well as Wojnarowicz&#x2019;s broad range of interests and influences, situating the artist in the art-historical canon and pushing beyond the biographical focus that has characterized much of the scholarship on Wojnarowicz to fully assess his paintings, photographs, installations, performances, and writing. A close examination of groups of works by David Kiehl sheds new light on the artist&#x2019;s process and the context in which the works were created. Essays by Julie Ault, Gregg Bordowitz, C. Carr, Marvin Taylor, and National Book Award finalist Hanya Yanagihara investigate the relationship between artistic production and cultural activism during the AIDS crisis, as well as provide a necessary accounting and close evaluation of divergent practices that have frequently been subsumed under broad labels like &#x201c;East Village,&#x201d; &#x201c;queer,&#x201d; &#x201c;postmodern,&#x201d; and &#x201c;neo-expressionist.&#x201d;</p><p>The most definitive source to date on David Wojnarowicz, which accompanies the first major retrospective on the artist in New York City since 1999.<br> &nbsp;<b>David Breslin</b> is Richard DeMartini Family Curator and Director of the Collection, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. <b>David Kiehl</b> is curator emeritus, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Works and Days, Theogony and The Shield of Heracles</h2><p>These three classics of Greek literature &#x2014; often called extended poems &#x2014; helped bridge the oral and written traditions of Greek civilization.

Indeed, the very idea that a vital Christian poetry might arise within our thoroughly secular culture seems almost inconceivable. Is it possible that a body of Christian poetry is now being produced whose literary merit is equal to its religious conviction? David Impastato's splendid anthology, <em>Upholding Mystery</em>, answers that question with a resounding and surprising "yes."<br> From Andrew Hudgins' often humorous narratives to Geoffery Hill's darkly impassioned lyrics, from Denise Levertov's incisive personal and political insights to Wendell Berry's lovely evocations of the divine presence in nature, <em>Upholding Mystery</em> offers readers a wide range of both poetic and spiritual satisfactions. Featuring only poets who are currently writing--including such well-known poets as Richard Wilbur, Annie Dillard, Daniel Berrigan, Les Murray, and Louise Erdrich, along with the impressive though less-known voices of David Craig, Scott Cairns, and David Brendan Hopes--this superb anthology provides generous selections of work that is admirable equally for the stature of its verse and for its illumination of the Christian ethos. By limiting the number of poets included, this collection allows readers to gain a thorough familiarity with each poet's work and to see how each struggles with, celebrates, and embodies a vision of the sacred throughout a personal body of verse. In addition, editor David Impastato provides brief, accessible, extremely helpful introductions that highlight the specifically Christian concerns of the poems, and he organizes the book into sections dealing with such topics as The Cross, Transformation, Injustice, Presence, Praise, The Mystical Body, and so on, thereby giving the reader a coherent theological journey as well as the pleasurable experience of the individual poems.<br> Here, then, is a contemporary encounter with Christian mystery, in poetry that is as vibrant, as compelling, and as meaningful as any being written today. David Impastato has done an invaluable service in showing that the transcendent is indeed alive and well in the hands of contemporary poets, despite reports to the contrary, and in gathering a dazzling array of poems that will appeal in equal measure to religious and literary readers alike.<br></p><p><br><strong>David Impastato</strong> has published on the subject of contemporary poetry, and his own poetry is soon to appear in <em>The Sewanee Review</em>. He worked for many years as a film director in Los Angeles, and is currently affiliated with the talking books program at the Library of Congress. He lives with his wife Nancy in Alexandria, Virginia. They have two sons and two grandchildren.<br>"At last Christianity finds its real voice. A wonderful choir!"--Rabbi Jacob Newsner, University of South Florida, Bard College<br><br>"These poems challenge the might of hopelessness that engulfs us on every side. A powerful and insightful collection!"--Reverend William R. Barr, Lexington Theological Seminary<br><br>"Most anthologies function as aesthetic manifestos. Each manifesto comes with assumptions about the nature of poetic experience and its uses. The anthology, Upholding Mystery, edited by David Impastato, is as revolutionary a document as Pound's Des Imagistes. The quality of the poems in<br>Upholding Mystery is much higher than in any of the modernist manifestos, however, and its uses are clearer: not only to delight but to instruct."--Jonathan Holden, author of The Fate of American Poetry<br><br>"Upholding Mystery is an astonishing book, which anyone with an interest in the relationship between poetry and the Christian faith will find indispensable."--Theology Today<br><br>"Like all the best anthologists, from Yvor Winters to Seamus Heaney and Ted Hughes, Impastato has assembled a collection with a delightfully unpredictable personal flavor."--Christianity Today<br><br>"A wonderful anthology of Christian poetry, which is, moreover, unafraid to put its Christianity up front, making it the thread tying together the book as a whole."--Crisis<br><br>"Upholding Mystery...proves there are excellent writers who are working within a Christian context."--Christianity and the Arts<br><br>"This is a wonderful book. Give copies of it for Christmas, and get one for yourself. If you are a teacher, order it for a class, and tell your colleagues about it. Spread the word."--John Wilson, Books and Culture: A Christian Review<br><br>"Impastato is an insightful reader and a considerate guide....In the accomplished hands of these poets the sounds and textures of the world frequently form poetic doorways to Christ. Upholding Mystery is well worth owning and cherishing. Read and ponder its lines slowly, savoring their<br>music."--Luis R.

Indolent, inattentive, incurious, given to daydreaming and procrastination, Oblomov clearly predates the ideal of the industrious modern man, yet he is impossible not to admire through Goncharov&#x2019;s masterful prose. Translator Marian Schwartz breathes new life into this Russian masterpiece in this, the first translation from the generally recognized definitive edition of the original, as well the first to attempt to replicate in English Goncharov&#x2019;s wry humor and all-embracing humanity. Replete with ingenious social satire and cutting criticism of nineteenth-century Russian&nbsp;society, this edition of <i>Oblomov</i> will introduce new readers to the novel that Leo Tolstoy praised as &#x201c;a truly great work, the likes of which one has not seen for a long, long time.&#x201d;</p></p><p>The sly, subversive side of the nineteenth-century Russian literary character -- the one which represents such a contrast to the titanic exertions of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky -- was most fully realized in Ivan Goncharov&#39;s 1859 masterpiece, OBLOMOV. This magnificent farce about a gentleman who spends the better part of his life in bed is a reminder of the extent to which humor, in the hands of a comic genius, can be used to explore the absurdities and injustices of a social order.<b>Ivan Goncharov</b> (1812&#x2013;1891) was born in Simbirsk, Russia, and is the author of three novels.&nbsp;Goncharov&#x2019;s short stories, essays, and memoirs were published posthumously in 1919. <b>Marian Schwartz</b> is a prize-winning translator of Russian fiction, history, biography, criticism, and fine art.

She lives in Austin, TX.</p><h2>Nathan Oliveira</h2><p>Nathan Oliveira's (1928--2010) passion for continuing an inner-directed artistic tradition attached to the human subject persisted throughout his more than forty years as a painter and master printmaker. His art represents an ongoing dialogue with artists from Rembrandt to Goya to Munch, Beckmann, Giacometti, and de Kooning--whom he recognized for their insights into the human condition. The human touch, so often absent in contemporary work, is distinct in Oliveira's art. His paintings and monotypes bear the mark of his brush in the tactile quality of the paint and the unique printed surfaces of his monotypes. He lived and worked in the San Francisco Bay Area, where he was professor emeritus of art at Stanford University, Oliveira is widely regarded as a key figure in American art, and his paintings, monoprints, drawings, watercolors, and sculpture have attracted an international audience. This book is the most comprehensive study to date of Oliveira's career as artist and teacher. Generously illustrated with 172 images, more than 100 in color, and including valuable, previously unpublished biographical and bibliographical information, <i>Nathan Oliveira </i> accompanied the major traveling exhibition of the same name.<br><br>Peter Selz's authoritative text weaves key moments in Oliveira's professional life together with compelling readings of the paintings themselves. Selz, who curated the exhibition, succeeds brilliantly in establishing a sense of where Oliveira came from, what inspired him, and how he thought of himself as an artist. Selz discusses Oliveira's beginnings as the son of Portuguese immigrants, his early exposure to Bay Area artists, and his formative experience of studying with Max Beckmann. Selz also traces the artist's affinity to his older contemporaries, his search for an expressive relationship between form and space that found resonance in presentation of the single figure, and the exhibitions and collaborations that shaped his career.<br><br> Susan Landauer's introduction provides an overview of the artist's work, while Joann Moser considers Oliveira's prints and drawings. Gary Carson's chronology, bibliography, and list of Oliveira's solo exhibitions complete this landmark publication, which fills an important gap in bringing Oliveira's powerful paintings and prints to the attention of a much larger public.</p><p>"Nathan Oliveira casts a serious eye and gives a balanced account both of the California milieu in which Oliveira was formed and the artist himself. It is an authentic contribution to art history and a much-needed exploration of the rich culture of California art." Dore Ashton, Professor of Art History, The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art<br><br>"Peter Selz and Joann Moser have produced an important study of the career and work of Oliveira, a stubbornly individual artist who, heedless of the clamor of the ideologies and the lure of the market, has resolutely gone his own way, these past fifty years, as painter, printmaker, and sculptor." Lorenz Eitner, Osgood Hooker Professor of Fine Arts, Emeritus, Stanford University<br><br>"Peter Selz, the expert art historian, has written a well-researched and passionate study of the painter and printmaker Nathan Oliveira. This fine book, illustrated by more than 200 examples of the artist's innovative work, confirms Oliveira's place in the front rank of American artists." James Schevill, Poet and author of <i>The American Fantasies</i><br><br>"Nathan Oliveira is one of the leading figures of his generation as a painter, printmaker, and re-discoverer of monotype, and a comprehensive gathering and discussion of his work has been needed for some time. Peter Selz has brought forth just the book that was needed touching on formative influences, friendships and teaching stints, throughout his career, and the parallel surges and fallow periods in all media of his work. The remarkable momentum of the artist&#x2019;s career in printmaking and monotype is also traced separately by Joann Moser." Gerald Nordland, author of <i>Richard Diebenkorn</i>&#34;Nathan Oliveira casts a serious eye and gives a balanced account both of the California milieu in which Oliveira was formed and the artist himself. It is an authentic contribution to art history and a much-needed exploration of the rich culture of California art.&#34;-Dore Ashton, author of Noguchi East and West &#34;Peter Selz and Joann Moser have produced an important study of the career and work of Oliveira, a stubbornly individual artist who, heedless of the clamor of the ideologies and the lure of the market, has resolutely gone his own way, these past fifty years, as painter, printmaker, and sculptor.&#34;-Lorenz Eitner, author of French Paintings of the 19th Century &#34;This fine book, illustrated by more than 200 examples of the artist&#39;s innovative work, confirms Oliveira&#39;s place in the front rank of American artists.&#34;-James Schevill, author of New and Selected Poems</p><h2>An Economic and Social History of the Ottoman Empire (An Economic and Social History of the Ottoman Empire, 1300&#x2013;1914 2 Volume Paperback Set)</h2><p>This major contribution to Ottoman history is now published in paperback in two volumes: the original single hardback volume (CUP 1995) has been widely acclaimed as a landmark in the study of one of the most enduring and influential empires of modern times. The authors provide a richly detailed account of the social and economic history of the Ottoman region, from the origins of the Empire around 1300 to the eve of its destruction during World War One. The breadth of range and the fullness of coverage make these two volumes essential for an understanding of contemporary developments in both the Middle East and the post-Soviet Balkan world.</p><p>&#34;For years to come, this volume will be the standard reference work on the economic and social history of the Ottoman Empire...&#34; Choice</p><h2>Violent Origins: Walter Burkert, Renï¿½ Girard, and Jonathan Z. Smith on Ritual Killing and Cultural Formation</h2><p>Burkert, Girard, and Smith hold important and contradictory theories about the nature and origin of ritual sacrifice, and the role violence plays in religion and culture. These papers and conversations derive from a conference that pursued the possibility and utility of a general theory of religion and culture, especially one based on violence. The special value of this volume is the conversations as such&#x2015;the real record of working scholars engaged with one another's theories, as they make and meet challenges, and move and maneuver. Girard and Burkert present different versions of the same conviction: that a single theory can account for ritual and its social function, a theory that posits original acts of group violence. Smith sharply questions both the possibility and the utility of such a general theory. Among the highlights of this stimulating interchange of ideas is a searching criticism of Girard's theory of generative scapegoating, which he answers with clarity and conviction, and a challenging of Burkert's theory of the origin of sacrifice in the hunt by Smith's argument, posed as a <i>jeu d'esprit,</i> that sacrifice originates with the domestication of animals.</p><p>Walter Burkert is Professor Emeritus of Classical Philology at the University of Zurich. Renï¿½ Girard is Andrew B. Hammond Professor Emeritus of French Language, Literature, and Civilization at Stanford University.&#39;This fascinating book is the result of a conference that brought together, for the purpose of debate and dialogue, the authors of some of the most important, current theories about the origins and meaning of sacrifice ... This isa high-powered look at the topic by the scholars generating the approaches being taken today.&#39; Choice</p><h2>Richard Morris Hunt</h2><p>Richard Morris Hunt is the definitive biography of the man who was widely regarded by his contemporaries as the dean of American architects and who was a seminal figure in establishing architecture as a profession in the United States. Covering all of Hunt&#39;s major commissions -- including his famous fifth Avenue mansions and Newport &#34;cottages&#34; -- the book provides a fresh look at the artistic achievements of America&#39;s Gilded Age.Paul Baker&#39;s reassessment of Hunt&#39;s works naturally covers his most famous buildings, such as The Breakers and Marble House in Newport, Biltmore House in North Carolina, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the base for the Statue of Liberty. But it also reveals Hunt&#39;s designs for houses on a more intimate scale, public buildings and monuments, and commercial structures.</p><p><p>Paul R.

The authors featured were all influenced by Akai Tori (Red Bird), a Tokyo children&#39;s literary magazine and also wrote for adult audiences. The stories are striking in that they differ little in style and content from those written for adults.</p><p>This slim anthology of 11 short stories, one play, and five poems includes works initially aimed at young adults by several of Japan's most important writers of the early 20th century, including Akutagawa Ryunosuke, Arishima Takeo, Dazai Osamu, and Kinoshita Junji. Translator Ohta, who holds degrees from Barnard College and the University of Chicago, employs an equally fluid and pleasant English style whether a piece is read silently or aloud. The subjects of the stories offer a diverse range, from the daily to the fantastic. Best in the former category is Shiga Noaya's "Kuma," with its dog chase through the streets of Tokyo. Keico Watanabe's line drawings are an especially apt accompaniment to this story. Akutagawa's "The Spider's Thread," a Buddhist allegory, leads the reader onto a more somber and contemplative plane. The anthology might have more coherence if the one short play and five short poems were omitted; tacked on the end of the volume, they seem to be something of an afterthought.

Based on extensive research and personal experience with the last working Shaker community in Maine, this book traces the roots of Shaker design to Shaker belief, which inspired the clean lines, careful craftsmanship, and signature details that define the style. The author also discusses the less known Victorian period of Shaker design and shows how this style has influenced subsequent ones. A bibliography, glossary, and index are included.</p><p>Many appreciate the clean, simple lines of traditional Shaker furniture, yet few know the people behind the designs or the spiritual beliefs that play such an integral part in both their work and daily lives. In his book, <i>The Shaker Legacy: Perspectives on an Enduring Furniture Style</i>, author Christian Becksvoort, a contributing editor of <i>Fine Woodworking</i> magazine and an experienced custom furniture maker and restorer who's worked for the last remaining Shaker community at Sabbathday Lake, Maine, examines the Shakers' faith in relation to their furniture. Becksvoort believes that "understanding Shaker furniture requires understanding the faith of the people who created it." Their religious practices--the constant striving for spiritual perfection in everything they did, the desire to emulate Christ and to live practically, "purely, free of vanity, greed, and pride"--permeate Becksvoort's insightful discussions of the Shaker culture, their recognized inventiveness (inventions include the circular saw, apple peeler, wash mill, and chimney cap), their influence on other furniture styles, and finally the furniture itself, which is the focal point of the book. Highly perfected, free of vain ornamentation, and utterly utilitarian, the furniture is indeed the Shaker faith in physical form. In addition to covering the classics--including the ladder-back chair, trestle table, and the built-in--Becksvoort points out subtle variations in design that existed from community to community: the curved, cutout base of a case of drawers was typical for the communities in Ohio, while bevel-edged drawer lips and straight, tapered feet on a blanket box point to the Mount Lebanon community. Becksvoort's intelligent account of the Shakers and their furniture, combined with hundreds of full-color photographs, taken on location at various communities and pulled from archives, make <i>The Shaker Legacy</i> a beautiful tribute to these talented craftsmen and their enduring design. <i>--Stefanie Hargreaves</i><p>Becksvoort builds custom furniture for well-known Shaker collectors.</p></p><h2>Seeley's Anatomy &amp; Physiology</h2><p>This text is written for the two semester anatomy &amp; physiology course. Seeley's A&amp;P&nbsp;writing is comprehensive, providing the depth necessary for those courses not requiring prerequisites, and yet, is presented with such clarity that it nicely balances the thorough coverage. Clear descriptions and exceptional illustrations combine to help students develop a firm understanding of the concepts of anatomy and physiology and to teach them how to use that information. Great care has been taken to select important concepts and to perfectly describe the anatomy of cells, organs, and organ systems. To emphasize the concepts of anatomy and physiology, the Seeley A&amp;P&nbsp;authors provide explanations of how the systems respond to aging, changes in physical activity, and disease, with a special focus on homeostasis and the regulatory mechanisms that maintain it. This text has more clinical content than any other A &amp; P book on the market.</p><p>Dr. Rod Seeley holds a B.S. in Zoolgy from Idaho State University and an M.S. and Ph.D. in Zoology from Utah State University. By being very involved in the methods and mechanism that help students learn, Rod contributes with his teaching expertise and proven ability to communicate effectively.<br><br>Cinnamon L.

In the decade that saw the rise of the Nazis, much of the thinking world sought guidance from this extraordinary group of intellectuals. Herbert Lottman's chronicle follows the influential players&#x2014;Gide, Malraux, Sartre, de Beauvoir, Koestler, Camus, and their pro-Fascist counterparts&#x2014;through the German occupation, Liberation, and into the Cold War, when the struggle between superpowers all but drowned out their voices.<br> <br> "Surprisingly fresh and intense. . . .

Such an ideal situation--entirely unplanned--could not last forever; the author shows how market forces squeezed out this art utopia, to be replaced by a shadow of its former self.</p><p>Richard Kostelanetz is a critic and literary artist. He moved to SoHo just as it was being developed by the underground arts community, and his home-apply named WordShip-has become one of the most famous loft/work space environments of the city. He is the author of over 40 original books as well as 40 edited volumes. He lives in New York City.Artist and author Kostelanetz writes with firsthand knowledge of the place and its people, tracing SoHo from its heyday as an eclectic center of artistic expression in the 1970s to its discovery by the mainstream and subsequent transformation into the pricey world of chic. -- Carol J. Binkowski, <em>Library Journal</em><br>The chapters that focus on Nam June Paik, Meredith Monk, Richard Foreman, and other such pivotal figures offer the book's best insights into the essence of the SoHo phenomenon. -- Carol J. Binkowski, <em>Library Journal</em><br>There is plenty of detailed description throughout about everything from startling sculpture and performance art and the design of offbeat lofts to the complicated mechanics of funding and the protocol of garbage scavenging. -- Carol J. Binkowski, <em>Library Journal</em><br>Of particular interest to artists and New York City buffs, this savvy little history should also be appealing to those intrigued by the sociology of counterculture and the traditions of avant-garde art. -- Carol J. Binkowski, <em>Library Journal</em><br>Books at once this informative and this much fun are rare. Here is city history--neighborhood history--at its best. What starts off looking like a no frills account, develops authority, presence, and drive. Read it, and the art of that time, that place will simply make more sense. It's a book I'm glad I read and am personally grateful to Kostelanetz for having written. -- Samuel R. Delany<br>New York's SoHo, by an uncanny series of accidents, became one of the great magical places of the late twentieth-century. There are many people around the world today, including me, who were drawn to downtown in its prime and who mourn what is gone. The amazing thing though is that SoHo happened at all. Richard Kostelanetz was there from the start and lived through its glory days from inside. He offers thick, rich descriptions of people, institutions, and events, explains the unlikely synergies that made it possible, and above all captures its aura. Without intending to do it, Kostelanetz convinces us that creative buildings, blocks, streets, and neighborhoods can come into being again. -- Marshal Berman<br>A very important first hand contribution to the history of a unique art community that changed not only the art, but also the City, of New York. -- Jonas Mekas<br>For those who want to read up on media and performance artists and others who were active in SoHo in the 70s and 80s, Kotelanetz's book will be a useful reference. He has probably the best and most even-handed description of George Maciunas, the Fluxus artist and creative developer of the first SoHo co-ops. -- SoHo Artists Foundation/ Ingrid Wiegand<br>For those who want to read up on media and performance artists and others who were active in SoHo in the 70s and 80s, Kotelanetz's book will be a useful reference.

The Burr Conspiracy was a cause cï¿½lï¿½bre of the early republic&#x2015;with Burr cast as the chief villain of the Founding Fathers&#x2015;even as the evidence against him was vague and conflicting. Rather than trying to discover the real intentions of Burr or his accusers&#x2015;Thomas Jefferson foremost among them&#x2015;James E.

What does it mean to be a Christian artist? What is the relationship between faith and art? Through L'Engle's beautiful and insightful essay, readers will find themselves called to what the author views as the prime tasks of an artist: to listen, to remain aware, and to respond to creation through one's own art.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p><i>Walking on Water</i> collects 12 brief meditations by Madeleine L'Engle on the nature of art and its relation to faith. L'Engle, the beloved author of <i>A Wrinkle In Time</i> among others, has written and spoken widely and wisely about the connection between religion and art. The gist of her understanding is as follows: <blockquote>To try to talk about art and about Christianity is for me one and the same thing, and it means attempting to share the meaning of my life, what gives it, for me, its tragedy and its glory. It is what makes me respond to the death of an apple tree, the birth of a puppy, northern lights shaking the sky, by writing stories.</blockquote> She believes that "[b]asically there can be no categories such as 'religious' art and 'secular' art because all true art is incarnational, and therefore 'religious.'" And "incarnation," in L'Engle's view, means "God's revelation of himself through particularity." In this book there is some slippage between L'Engle's autobiographical and critical voices. As a result, she often claims Christian significance for works whose meaning is not intentionally Christian. She admits this freely: <blockquote>[B]ecause I am a struggling Christian, it's inevitable that I superimpose my awareness of all that happened in the life of Jesus upon what I'm reading, upon Buber, upon Plato, upon the Book of Daniel. But I'm not sure that's a bad thing. To be truly Christian means to see Christ everywhere, to know him as all in all.</blockquote> <i>-- Michael Joseph Gross</i>&#x201c;When I discovered <i>Walking on Water</i> years ago, my creative self underwent a sort of liberation. I had always sensed that there was a wonderful connection between spirituality and creativity, but Madeleine&#x2019;s insights about both of those worlds helped me claim with more confidence my own creative gifts. This is a wise and inspiring book that should be in every artist&#x2019;s library.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2013;Vinita Hampton Wright, author of <i>Grace at Bender Springs</i> and <i>Velma Still Cooks in Leeway <br><br></i></b>&#x201c;Once again<i>,</i> L&#x2019;Engle touches the deepest parts of our psyche and heart with her artist&#x2019;s wand. She writes with an earthy rhythm that not only reveals the mysteries of our artistic natures, but also qualifies all along the way her inimitable wise-woman philosophies. L&#x2019;Engle&#x2019;s writing is God&#x2019;s gift to a generation who needs to sit on a stump and lend an ear to what the right brain is saying to the left and to what the soul is saying to the heart. <i>Walking on Water</i> guides the wandering artist back to the Savior and says &#x2018;There, you&#x2019;ve come home again where you belong!&#x2019;&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2013;Patricia Hickman, award-winning author of <i>Katrina&#x2019;s Wings<br><br></i></b>&#x201c;There are those who write about art-making as if they&#x2019;re detailing the techniques of a heart surgeon. Then there are those, like Madeleine L&#x2019;Engle, who simply show you their heart. Like the words of Jesus to the fisherman brothers, the words of Madeleine are &#x2018;follow me&#x2019; words. Through the pages of <i>Walking on Water</i> hungry, thirsty folks have been following for two decades&#x2013;quickly recognizing that the reason Madeleine is worth following is that she follows Jesus.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2013;Charlie Peacock-Ashworth, record producer and author of <i>At the Crossroads: An Insider's Look at Contemporary Christian Music</i></b></p><h2>The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway: The Hemingway Library Collector&#39;s Edition</h2><p>The fourth in the series of new annotated editions of Ernest Hemingway&#x2019;s work, edited by the author&#x2019;s grandson Seï¿½n and introduced by his son Patrick, this collection includes the best of the well-known classics as well as unpublished stories, early drafts, and notes that provide fascinating insight into the writing process of one of America&#x2019;s greatest storytellers.<br><br>Ernest Hemingway is a cultural icon&#x2014;an archetype of rugged masculinity, a romantic ideal of the intellectual in perpetual exile&#x2014;but, to his countless readers, Hemingway remains a literary force much greater than his image. Of all of Hemingway&#x2019;s canonical fictions, perhaps none demonstrate so forcefully the power of the author&#x2019;s revolutionary style as his short stories. In classics like &#x201c;Hills like White Elephants,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Snows of Kilimanjaro,&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber,&#x201d; Hemingway shows us great literature compressed to its most potent essentials. We also see, in Hemingway&#x2019;s short fiction, the tales that created the legend: these are stories of men and women in love and in war and on the hunt, stories of a lost generation born into a fractured time.<br> <br> This Collector's Edition of <i>The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway</i> presents many of Hemingway&#x2019;s most famous classics alongside rare and unpublished material: Hemingway&#x2019;s early drafts and correspondence, his dazzling out-of-print essay on the art of the short story, and two marvelous examples of his earliest work--his first published story, &#x201c;The Judgment of Manitou,&#x201d; which Hemingway wrote when still a high school student, and a never-before-published story, written when the author was recovering from a war injury in Milan after WWI. Edited by Ernest Hemingway&#x2019;s grandson, Seï¿½n Hemingway, with an introduction by the author&#x2019;s only surviving son, Patrick Hemingway, this Library Edition offers vital insight into the artistic development of one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s greatest writers. It is a perfect introduction for a new generation of Hemingway readers, and it is a vital edition in the collection of any true Hemingway fan.</p><p>The Short Stories, originally published in 1938, is definitive. Among these forty-nine short stories are Hemingway&#39;s earliest efforts, written when he was a young foreign correspondent in Paris, and such masterpieces as &#39;Hills Like White Elephants, &#39; &#39;The Killers, &#39; &#39;The Short, Happy Life of Francis Macomber, &#39; and &#39;The Snows of Kilimanjaro.&#39;Ernest Hemingway did more to influence the style of English prose than any other writer of his time. Publication of&nbsp;<i>The Sun Also Rises</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>A Farewell to Arms</i>&nbsp;immediately established him as one of the greatest literary lights of the 20th century. His classic novella&nbsp;<i>The Old Man and the Sea&nbsp;</i>won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. He died in 1961.</p><h2>Psychoanalytic Treatment: An Intersubjective Approach (Psychoanalytic Inquiry Book Series)</h2><p><em>Psychoanalytic Treatment: An Intersubjective Approach</em> fleshes out the implications for psychoanalytic understanding and treatment of adopting a consistently intersubjective perspective.&nbsp; In the course of the study, the intersubjective viewpoint is demonstrated to illuminate a wide array of clinical phenomena, including transference and resistance, conflict formation, therapeutic action, affective and self development, and borderline and psychotic states.&nbsp; As a consequence, the authors demonstrate that an intersubjective approach greatly facilitates empathic access to the patient's subjective world and, in the same measure, greatly enhances the scope and therapeutic effectiveness of psychoanalysis.&nbsp; <em>Psychoanalytic Treatment </em>is another step in the ongoing development of intersubjectivity theory, as born out in <em>Structures of Subjectivity </em>(1984), <em>Contexts of Being</em> (1992), and <em>Working Intersubjectively </em>(1997), all published by the Analytic Press</p><p></p><h2>Einstein&#39;s Cosmos: How Albert Einstein&#39;s Vision Transformed Our Understanding of Space and Time (Great Discoveries)</h2><p><p><strong>A dazzling tour of the universe as Einstein saw it.<br></strong></p> How did Albert Einstein come up with the theories that changed the way we look at the world? By thinking in pictures. Michio Kaku leading theoretical physicist (a cofounder of string theory) and best-selling science storyteller shows how Einstein used seemingly simple images to lead a revolution in science. Daydreaming about racing a beam of light led to the special theory of relativity and the equation E = mc2. Thinking about a man falling led to the general theory of relativity giving us black holes and the Big Bang. Einstein's failure to come up with a theory that would unify relativity and quantum mechanics stemmed from his lacking an apt image. Even in failure, however, Einstein's late insights have led to new avenues of research as well as to the revitalization of the quest for a "Theory of Everything." With originality and expertise, Kaku uncovers the surprising beauty that lies at the heart of Einstein's cosmos.</p><p>Michio Kaku, a theoretical physicist, famed futurist and acclaimed public speaker, is the author of numerous New York Times bestselling books including The Future of the Mind, Physics of the Future, and Physics of the Impossible. He hosts Science Fantastic, a nationally broadcast radio show, and lives in New York City.Recent popular works about Einstein have magnified select details of his life, such as his tempestuous marriage to Mileva Maric (<i>Einstein in Love,</i> by Dennis Overbye, 2000) or his FBI file (<i>The Einstein File,</i> by Fred Jerome [BKL Ap 1 03]). Such topics are reduced to paragraphs in Kaku's presentation, for Einstein's life ranks second to his science here. Accordingly, Kaku divides his narrative into the three great segments of Einstein's scientific arc: the theory of special relativity in 1905; the theory of general relativity in 1916; and the balance of Einstein's intellectual life. The latter was spent searching for a unified field theory and saw the rise of his phenomenal celebrity, which his peers regarded as a dubious dissipation of genius. However, such lamentations were premature, according to Kaku, who explicates recent discoveries that show Einstein was only audaciously ahead of his scientific time, as usual. An expert in quantum mechanics and string theory, Kaku is an equally able popular writer, vividly evoking the pictorial imagination behind Einstein's revolutionary thinking. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Here is the indispensable reference that should accompany the instrument aboard. Cmdr. Bruce Bauer, a professional navigator and master mariner with the U.S. Merchant Marine, has distilled years of hands-on experience into an eminently readable guide to buying, adjusting, using, and repairing sextants. </p><p><i>The Sextant Handbook</i> is dedicated to the premise that electronic navigation devices, while too convenient to disregard, are too vulnerable to rely on exclusively. The book is designed to make beginner and expert alike conversant with this most beautiful and functional of the navigator's tools. Topics include: </p><ul> <li>Assembly and Disassembly </li><li>Vital Adjustments </li><li>Avoiding Problems </li><li>Rough Weather Sightings </li><li>Oiling and Cleaning </li><li>Immersion Baths </li><li>Emergency Silvering </li><li>Finding and Buying Used Sextants </li><li>And Much More </li></ul> <p>You'll also find a list of distributors, manufacturers, and dealers worldwide, a discussion of future trends, and numerous helpful hints, including sighting with eyeglasses and using a Rude starfinder. All in a thoroughly revised edition of a book acclaimed by navigation professionals.</p></p><p><p>"The wealth of useful material is prodigious and by the time one has reached the back cover, the sextant is an old friend. Just as important, Cdr. Bauer deals comprehensively with maintenance and service, and his advice on how to select and assess a second-hand sextant is truly worthwhile. Refreshingly, he writes in a friendly manner--almost as though he is chatting to a group of students. A thoroughly enjoyable book."--Peter Milne, Technical Editor, <i>Yachting World Magazine</i> (England) </p><p>"If this book is a highly detailed technical manual, the reader is hardly aware, so plentiful are the diversions into related topics. It makes great reading and virtually everyone . . . regardless of one's skill level with a sextant . . . will find new things to learn about sextants, their history, their future and their best use."--<i>Ocean Navigator</i> </p><p>"The sextant and Commander Bauer's handbook should be standard equipment on every seagoing vessel. It is a book that should be provided with every sextant and class in navigating."--R. J. Holt, Director, Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum </p><p>"One recognizes here a centennial Lecky on the sextant. There is plenty of new material presented in a manner that would make a stranger want to meet Bruce Bauer and converse with him face to face."--Paul M. Anderton, Navigation Instructor </p><p>"Cdr. Bauer's book will become a standard reference on the sextant for professional and amateur navigators around the world. I have been doing celestial navigation since 1953 and have not, until now, been able to find so much information on the sextant collected in one place."--A. W. Fowler, Ocean Racing Navigator </p><p>"Bauer has succeeded in gathering a wealth of information from a multitude of sources and brought it all together into a fascinating book for the mariner. I recommend it to those who navigate the ocean's highways."--Warren P. Davis, Colonel, USA (Ret.), Sextant Authority </p><p>"Insecurity is sitting on a boat in the middle of the ocean staring at an out-of-whack sextant and not knowing how to fix it. I know from experience. This book should be mandatory equipment on every boat that goes offshore."--Wayne Carpenter, Author, <i>The Voyage of Kristina</i></p><b>Cmdr. Bruce A.

Pursuing mysterious cases, she works undercover and only introduces herself as a detective when the need arises. Her personal circumstances and even her real name are never revealed. This obfuscation makes sense, considering that when <em>The Female Detective</em> was first published in 1864 there were no official female detectives in Britain&#x2015;in fact, there were no women police officers either (and would not be for another 50 years). And the novel itself was well ahead of its time; further stories and novels featuring women detectives would not be widely published until the turn of the century.</p></p><p><p><strong>ANDREW FORRESTER</strong> was the pseudonym of James Redding Ware (1832-1909). Among his other books were <em>Revelations of a Private Detective</em> (1863), and <em>Secret Service</em>, or <em>Recollections of a City Detective</em> (1864).</p>The stories are varied in subject and style; some are recognizable as traditional detective fiction, some more anecdotal and not directly related to Miss B. I enjoyed reading them all. (Nancy A Bekofske <i>The Literate Quilter</i>)<br><br>This book is going to make a lot of literary critics and scholars happy because there&#x2019;s so much to dig through. (Annie Smith <i>A Bookish Type</i>)<br><br>This book has fabulous historic value of the writing of the time, both in writing style and how stories where told. (<i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>The latest reprint in the British Library Crime Classics is one of the earliest: a cycle of stories about a London detective first published in 1864, here introduced by Alexander McCall Smith, who ventures general remarks about female detectives, and Mike Ashley, who supplies some uncommonly informative historical background. Even her closest friends think she's a milliner, but Miss Gladden&#x2014;not her real name, but "the name I assume most frequently while in my business" &#x2014;can look back with pride on her secret career as a professional inquiry agent with a subtly shifting relationship to the Metropolitan Police. In "The Unknown Weapon," her inquiries help the police discover who murdered young squire Graham Petleigh in his father's manor house. In "The Judgment of Conscience," she's able to set the police straight about a lower-class romantic triangle that ends in tragedy. In "Tenant for Life," her unofficial investigation, launched when she overhears a friend's chance remark to her cabman husband about "Little Fourpenny Number Two way," uncovers a plot to defraud the legal heir of a sizable estate. And her only role in the fact-based "A Child Found Dead: Murder Or No Murder" is to introduce a doctor friend who introduces his own childhood friend, Hardal, who does the sleuthing honors when a young boy taken from his bed is found dead nearby. "Georgy" ruefully recounts a blithe embezzler's success in eluding both his conscience and any legal consequences of his theft. The most strikingly modern notes struck throughout all the stories, in fact, are Miss Gladden's frequent failure to bring wrongdoers to justice and her regrets over the outcomes of her cases. The creaking dialogue and halting, step-by-step-by-step deductions, which guarantee a glacial pace, will keep most of the curious at bay; this is no overlooked gem. But feminists and historical completists, the most likely readers to persevere, will find themselves amply rewarded by detective tales that more often focus on how and why than whodunit. (<i>Kirkus</i>)<br><br>It's easy to read and quite enjoyable. (<i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>Another fantastic classic from the British library classic crime collection. I can never fail to be riveted by these titles and the Female Detective is no exception. Perfect for fans of Dorothy Sayers and Agatha Christie. A engrossing classic crime to keep readers old and new alike hooked and booked for hours. (<i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>There are plenty of touches of humour and an excellent knowledge of human nature in the stories (Jill Weekes <i>Jillysheep</i>)<br><br>I liked flow and her use of the English language in setting the mood and the characters. (Arlene Caney <i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>The Female Detective is the first novel in British fiction to feature a professional female detective. Written by Andrew Forrester, it was originally published in 1864. The protagonist is Miss Gladden, or &#x2018;G&#x2019; as she is also known the precursor to Miss Marple, Mma Ramotswe and Lisbeth Salander. Miss Gladden&#x2019;s deductive methods and energetic approach anticipate those of Arthur Conan Doyle&#x2019;s Sherlock Holmes, and she can be seen as beginning a powerful tradition of female detectives in these seven short stories. &#x2018;G&#x2019; uses similar methods to her male counterparts she enters scenes of crime incognito, tracking down killers while trying to conceal her own tracks and her identity from others. &#x2018;G&#x2019;, the first female detective, does much physical detective work, examining crime scenes, looking for clues and employing all manner of skill, subterfuge, observation and charm solve crimes. Like Holmes, &#x2018;G&#x2019; regards the regular constabulary with disdain. For all the intrigue and interest of the stories, little is ever revealed about &#x2018;G&#x2019; herself, and her personal circumstances remain a mystery throughout. But it is her ability to apply her considerable energy and intelligence to solve crimes that is her greatest appeal, and the reappearance of the original lady detective will be welcomed by fans of crime fiction.

No one can resist her bright hazel eyes and dazzling smile.

But undreamed-of challenges await as the world of Ingleside becomes endangered by a faraway war. When her brothers go off to fight and Rilla brings home an orphaned newborn in a soup tureen, she is swept into a drama that tests her courage and leaves her changed forever.</p><p>Lucy Maud Montgomery (November 30, 1874&#x2013;April 24, 1942) publicly known as L.M. Montgomery, was a Canadian author best known for a series of novels beginning with <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>, published in 1908. <i>Anne of Green Gables</i> was an immediate success. The central character, Anne, an orphaned girl, made Montgomery famous in her lifetime and gave her an international following. The first novel was followed by a series of sequels. Montgomery went on to publish twenty novels as well as 500 short stories and poems. Because many of the novels were set on Prince Edward Island, Canada and the Canadian province became literary landmarks. She was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1935.Rilla of Ingleside <br><br> GLEN &#x201c;NOTES&#x201d; AND OTHER MATTERS<p></p> <br>It was a warm, golden-cloudy, lovable afternoon. In the big living room at Ingleside, Susan Baker sat down with a certain grim satisfaction hovering about her like an aura; it was four o&#x2019;clock and Susan, who had been working incessantly since six that morning, felt that she had fairly earned an hour of repose and gossip. Susan just then was perfectly happy; everything had gone almost uncannily well in the kitchen that day. Dr. Jekyll had not been Mr. Hyde and so had not grated on her nerves; from where she sat she could see the pride of her heart&#x2014;the bed of peonies of her own planting and culture, blooming as no other peony plot in Glen St. Mary ever did or could bloom, with peonies crimson, peonies silvery pink, peonies white as drifts of winter snow.<br> <br>Susan had on a new black silk blouse, quite as elaborate as anything Mrs. Marshall Elliott ever wore, and a white starched apron, trimmed with complicated crocheted lace fully five inches wide, not to mention insertion to match. Therefore Susan had all the comfortable consciousness of a well-dressed woman as she opened her copy of the Daily Enterprise and prepared to read the Glen &#x201c;Notes&#x201d; which, as Miss Cornelia had just informed her, filled half a column of it and mentioned almost everybody at Ingleside. There was a big, black headline on the front page of the Enterprise, stating that some Archduke Ferdinand or other had been assassinated at a place bearing the weird name of Sarajevo, but Susan tarried not over uninteresting, immaterial stuff like that; she was in quest of something really vital. Oh, here it was&#x2014;&#x201c;Jottings from Glen St. Mary.&#x201d; Susan settled down keenly, reading each one over aloud to extract all possible gratification from it.<br> <br>Mrs. Blythe and her visitor, Miss Cornelia&#x2014;alias Mrs. Marshall Elliott&#x2014;were chatting together near the open door that led to the veranda, through which a cool, delicious breeze was blowing, bringing whiffs of phantom perfume from the garden, and charming gay echoes from the vine-hung corner where Rilla and Miss Oliver and Walter were laughing and talking. Wherever Rilla Blythe was, there was laughter.<br> <br>There was another occupant of the living room, curled up on a couch, who must not be overlooked, since he was a creature of marked individuality, and, moreover, had the distinction of being the only living thing whom Susan really hated.<br> <br>All cats are mysterious but Dr. Jekyll-and-Mr. Hyde&#x2014;&#x201c;Doc&#x201d; for short&#x2014;was trebly so. He was a cat of double personality&#x2014;or else, as Susan vowed, he was possessed by the devil. To begin with, there had been something uncanny about the very dawn of his existence. Four years previously Rilla Blythe had had a treasured darling of a kitten, white as snow, with a saucy black tip to its tail, which she called Jack Frost. Susan disliked Jack Frost, though she could not or would not give any valid reason therefor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Take my word for it, Mrs. Dr. dear,&#x201d; she was wont to say ominously, &#x201c;that cat will come to no good.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But why do you think so?&#x201d; Mrs. Blythe would ask.<br> <br>&#x201c;I do not think&#x2014;I know,&#x201d; was all the answer Susan would vouchsafe.<br> <br>With the rest of the Ingleside folk Jack Frost was a favorite; he was so very clean and well groomed, and never allowed a spot or stain to be seen on his beautiful white suit; he had endearing ways of purring and snuggling; he was scrupulously honest.<br> <br>And then a domestic tragedy took place at Ingleside. Jack Frost had kittens!<br> <br>It would be vain to try to picture Susan&#x2019;s triumph. Had she not always insisted that that cat would turn out to be a delusion and a snare? Now they could see for themselves!<br> <br>Rilla kept one of the kittens, a very pretty one, with peculiarly sleek glossy fur of a dark yellow crossed by orange stripes, and large, satiny, golden ears. She called it Goldie and the name seemed appropriate enough to the little frolicsome creature which, during its kittenhood, gave no indication of the sinister nature it really possessed. Susan, of course, warned the family that no good could be expected from any offspring of that diabolical Jack Frost; but Susan&#x2019;s Cassandra-like croakings were unheeded.<br> <br>The Blythes had been so accustomed to regard Jack Frost as a member of the male sex that they could not get out of the habit. So they continually used the masculine pronoun, although the result was ludicrous. Visitors used to be quite electrified when Rilla referred casually to &#x201c;Jack and his kitten,&#x201d; or told Goldie sternly, &#x201c;Go to your mother and get him to wash your fur.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It is not decent, Mrs. Dr. dear,&#x201d; poor Susan would say bitterly. She herself compromised by always referring to Jack as &#x201c;it&#x201d; or &#x201c;the white beast,&#x201d; and one heart at least did not ache when &#x201c;it&#x201d; was accidentally poisoned the following winter.<br> <br>In a year&#x2019;s time Goldie became so manifestly an inadequate name for the orange kitten that Walter, who was just then reading Stevenson&#x2019;s story, changed it to Dr. Jekyll-and-Mr. Hyde. In his Dr. Jekyll mood the cat was a drowsy, affectionate, domestic, cushion-loving puss, who liked petting and gloried in being nursed and patted. Especially did he love to lie on his back and have his sleek, cream-colored throat stroked gently while he purred in somnolent satisfaction. He was a notable purrer; never had there been an Ingleside cat who purred so constantly and so ecstatically.<br> <br>&#x201c;The only thing I envy a cat is its purr,&#x201d; remarked Dr. Blythe once, listening to Doc&#x2019;s resonant melody. &#x201c;It is the most contented sound in the world.&#x201d;<br> <br>Doc was very handsome; his every movement was grace; his poses magnificent. When he folded his long, dusky-ringed tail about his feet and sat him down on the veranda to gaze steadily into space for long intervals the Blythes felt that an Egyptian sphinx could not have made a more fitting Deity of the Portal.<br> <br>When the Mr. Hyde mood came upon him&#x2014;which it invariably did before rain, or wind&#x2014;he was a wild thing with changed eyes. The transformation always came suddenly. He would spring fiercely from a reverie with a savage snarl and bite at any restraining or caressing hand. His fur seemed to grow darker and his eyes gleamed with a diabolical light. There was really an unearthly beauty about him. If the change happened in the twilight all the Ingleside folk felt a certain terror of him. At such times he was a fearsome beast and only Rilla defended him, asserting that he was &#x201c;such a nice prowly cat.&#x201d; Certainly he prowled.<br> <br>Dr. Jekyll loved new milk; Mr. Hyde would not touch milk and growled over his meat. Dr. Jekyll came down the stairs so silently that no one could hear him. Mr. Hyde made his tread as heavy as a man&#x2019;s. Several evenings, when Susan was alone in the house, he &#x201c;scared her stiff,&#x201d; as she declared, by doing this. He would sit in the middle of the kitchen floor, with his terrible eyes fixed unwinkingly upon hers for an hour at a time. This played havoc with her nerves, but poor Susan really held him in too much awe to try to drive him out. Once she had dared to throw a stick at him and he had promptly made a savage leap towards her. Susan rushed out of doors and never attempted to meddle with Mr. Hyde again&#x2014;though she visited his misdeeds upon the innocent Dr. Jekyll, chasing him ignominiously out of her domain whenever he dared to poke his nose in and denying him certain savory tidbits for which he yearned.<br> <br>&#x201c;?&#x2018;The many friends of Miss Faith Meredith, Gerald Meredith, and James Blythe,&#x2019;?&#x201d; read Susan, rolling the names like sweet morsels under her tongue, &#x201c;?&#x2018;were very much pleased to welcome them home a few weeks ago from Redmond College. James Blythe, who was graduated in Arts in 1913, had just completed his first year in medicine.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Faith Meredith has really got to be the most handsomest creature I ever saw,&#x201d; commented Miss Cornelia above her filet crochet. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s amazing how those children came on after Rosemary West went to the manse. People have almost forgotten what imps of mischief they were once. Anne, dearie, will you ever forget the way they used to carry on? It&#x2019;s really surprising how well Rosemary got on with them. She&#x2019;s more like a chum than a step-mother. They all love her and Una adores her. As for that little Bruce, Una just makes a perfect slave of herself to him. Of course, he is a darling. But did you ever see any child look as much like an aunt as he looks like his Aunt Ellen? He&#x2019;s just as dark and just as emphatic. I can&#x2019;t see a feature of Rosemary in him. Norman Douglas always vows at the top of his voice that the stork meant Bruce for him and Ellen and took him to the manse by mistake.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bruce adores Jem,&#x201d; said Mrs. Blythe. &#x201c;When he comes over here he follows Jem about silently like a faithful little dog, looking up at him from under his black brows. He would do anything for Jem, I verily believe.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are Jem and Faith going to make a match of it?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mrs. Blythe smiled. It was well known that Miss Cornelia, who had been such a virulent man-hater at one time, had actually taken to match-making in her declining years.<br> <br>&#x201c;They are only good friends yet, Miss Cornelia.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Very good friends, believe me,&#x201d; said Miss Cornelia emphatically. &#x201c;I hear all about the doings of the young fry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I have no doubt that Mary Vance sees that you do, Mrs. Marshall Elliott,&#x201d; said Susan significantly, &#x201c;but I think it is a shame to talk about children making matches.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Children! Jem is twenty-one and Faith is nineteen,&#x201d; retorted Miss Cornelia. &#x201c;You must not forget, Susan, that we old folks are not the only grown-up people in the world.&#x201d;<br> <br>Outraged Susan, who detested any reference to her age&#x2014;not from vanity but from a haunting dread that people might come to think her too old to work&#x2014;returned to her &#x201c;Notes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;?&#x2018;Carl Meredith and Shirley Blythe came home last Friday evening from Queen&#x2019;s Academy. We understand that Carl will be in charge of the school at Harbour Head next year and we are sure he will be a popular and successful teacher.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He will teach the children all there is to know about bugs, anyhow,&#x201d; said Miss Cornelia. &#x201c;He is through with Queen&#x2019;s now and Mr. Meredith and Rosemary wanted him to go right on to Redmond in the fall, but Carl has a very independent streak in him and means to earn part of his own way through college. He&#x2019;ll be all the better for it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;?&#x2018;Walter Blythe, who has been teaching for the past two years at Lowbridge, has resigned,&#x2019;?&#x201d; read Susan. &#x201c;?&#x2018;He intends going to Redmond this fall.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is Walter quite strong enough for Redmond yet?&#x201d; queried Miss Cornelia anxiously.<br> <br>&#x201c;We hope that he will be by the fall,&#x201d; said Mrs. Blythe. &#x201c;An idle summer in the open air and sunshine will do a great deal for him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Typhoid is a hard thing to get over,&#x201d; said Miss Cornelia emphatically, &#x201c;especially when one has had such a close shave as Walter had. I think he&#x2019;d do well to stay out of college another year. But then he&#x2019;s so ambitious. Are Di and Nan going too?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. They both wanted to teach another year but Gilbert thinks they had better go to Redmond this fall.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad of that. They&#x2019;ll keep an eye on Walter and see that he doesn&#x2019;t study too hard. I suppose,&#x201d; continued Miss Cornelia, with a side glance at Susan, &#x201c;that after the snub I got a few minutes ago it will not be safe for me to suggest that Jerry Meredith is making sheep&#x2019;s eyes at Nan.&#x201d;<br> <br>Susan ignored this and Mrs. Blythe laughed again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dear Miss Cornelia, I have my hands full, haven&#x2019;t I?&#x2014;with all these boys and girls sweethearting around me? If I took it seriously it would quite crush me. But I don&#x2019;t&#x2014;it is too hard yet to realize that they&#x2019;re grown up. When I look at those two tall sons of mine I wonder if they can possibly be the fat, sweet, dimpled babies I kissed and cuddled and sang to slumber the other day&#x2014;only the other day, Miss Cornelia. Wasn&#x2019;t Jem the dearest baby in the old House of Dreams? And now he&#x2019;s a B.A. and accused of courting.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re all growing older,&#x201d; sighed Miss Cornelia.<br> <br>&#x201c;The only part of me that feels old,&#x201d; said Mrs. Blythe, &#x201c;is the ankle I broke when Josie Pye dared me to walk the Barry ridge-pole in the Green Gables days. I have an ache in it when the wind is east. I won&#x2019;t admit that it is rheumatism, but it does ache. As for the children, they and the Merediths are planning a gay summer before they have to go back to studies in the fall. They are such a fun-loving little crowd. They keep this house in a perpetual whirl of merriment.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is Rilla going to Queen&#x2019;s when Shirley goes back?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t decided yet. I rather fancy not. Her father thinks she is not quite strong enough&#x2014;she has rather outgrown her strength&#x2014;she&#x2019;s really absurdly tall for a girl not yet fifteen. I am not anxious to have her go&#x2014;why, it would be terrible not to have a single one of my babies home with me next winter. Susan and I would fall to fighting with each other to break the monotony.&#x201d;<br> <br>Susan smiled at this pleasantry. The idea of her fighting with &#x201c;Mrs. Dr. dear&#x201d;!<br> <br>&#x201c;Does Rilla herself want to go?&#x201d; asked Miss Cornelia.<br> <br>&#x201c;No. The truth is, Rilla is the only one of my flock who isn&#x2019;t ambitious. I really wish she had a little more ambition. She has no serious ideals at all&#x2014;her sole aspiration seems to be to have a good time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And why should she not have it, Mrs. Dr. dear?&#x201d; cried Susan, who could not bear to hear a single word against any one of the Ingleside folk, even from one of themselves. &#x201c;A young girl should have a good time, and that I will maintain. There will be time enough for her to think of Latin and Greek.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I should like to see a little sense of responsibility in her, Susan. And you know yourself that she is abominably vain.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She has something to be vain about,&#x201d; retorted Susan. &#x201c;She is the prettiest girl in Glen St. Mary. Do you think that all those over-harbor MacAllisters and Crawfords and Elliotts could scare up a skin like Rilla&#x2019;s in four generations? They could not. No, Mrs. Dr. dear, I know my place but I cannot allow you to run down Rilla. Listen to this, Mrs. Marshall Elliott.&#x201d;<br> <br>Susan had found a chance to get square with Miss Cornelia for her digs at the children&#x2019;s love affairs. She read the item with gusto.<br> <br>&#x201c;?&#x2018;Miller Douglas has decided not to go West. He says old P.E.I. is good enough for him and he will continue to farm for his aunt, Mrs. Alec Davis.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>Susan looked keenly at Miss Cornelia.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have heard, Mrs. Marshall Elliott, that Miller is courting Mary Vance.&#x201d;<br> <br>This shot pierced Miss Cornelia&#x2019;s armor. Her sonsy face flushed.<br> <br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t have Miller Douglas hanging round Mary,&#x201d; she said crisply. &#x201c;He comes of a low family. His father was a sort of outcast from the Douglases&#x2014;they never really counted him in&#x2014;and his mother was one of those terrible Dillons from the Harbour Head.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think I have heard, Mrs. Marshall Elliott, that Mary Vance&#x2019;s own parents were not what you could call aristocratic.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mary Vance has had a good bringing up and she is a smart, clever, capable girl,&#x201d; retorted Miss Cornelia. &#x201c;She is not going to throw herself away on Miller Douglas, believe me! She knows my opinion on the matter and Mary has never disobeyed me yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I do not think you need worry, Mrs. Marshall Elliott, for Mrs. Alec Davis is as much against it as you could be, and says no nephew of hers is ever going to marry a nameless nobody like Mary...</p><h2>The Mediterranean World in Late Antiquity Ad 395-600 (Routledge History of the Ancient World)</h2><p>The Mediterranean World in Late Antiquity AD 395-600 deals with the exciting period commonly known as 'late antiquity' - the fifth and sixth centuries. The Roman empire in the west was splitting into separate Germanic kingdoms, while the Near East, still under Roman rule from Constantinople, maintained a dense population and flourishing urban culture until the Persian and Arab invasions of the early seventh century.<br>Averil Cameron places her emphasis on the material and literary evidence for cultural change and offers a new and original challenge to traditional assumptions of 'decline and fall' and 'the end of antiquity'. The book draws on the recent spate of scholarship on this period to discuss in detail such controversial issues as the effectiveness of the late Roman army, the late antique city and the nature of economic exchange and cultural life. With its extensive annotation, it provides a lively and often critical introduction to earlier approaches to the period, from Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire to the present day.<br>No existing book in English provides so detailed or up-to-date an introduction to the history of both halves of the empire in this crucial period, or discusses existing views in such a challenging way. Averil Cameron is a leading specialist on late antiquity, having written about the period and taught it for many years. This book has much to say to historians of all periods. It will be particularly welcomed by teachers and students of both ancient and medieval history.</p><p>University of Oxford, UK...as a summary of the state of the study, this book is invaluable- comprehensive, insightful, and wonderfully lucid. The endnotes alone make this text a superlative resource for advanced courses and seminars in classical and medieval history...Historians who focus on only one region of the Mediterranean...will be challenged by its breadth of vision, mastery of detail, and up-to-date currency..<br><b>&#x2013;<i> AHNC Journal, Vol. 4, Fall 1996</i></b></p><h2>The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit : Expert Methods for Designing, Developing, and Deploying Data Warehouses</h2><p>"A comprehensive, thoughtful, and detailed book that will be of inestimable value to anyone struggling with the complex details of designing, building, and maintaining an enterprise-wide decision support system.

Using a background of myth and fairy-tale to expand the boundaries of nineteenth-century realist fiction, Collins not only takes a blind person as his central character but also explores the idea of blindness and its implications. His sensitive presentation of the difficulties, disappointments, and occasional delights which follow the recovery of sight by someone blind since infancy is still one of the best accounts in fiction of a problem which continues to intrigue philosophers, psychologists, and the general public, as it has done since it was first discussed by Locke and Berkeley in the eighteenth century.William Wilkie Collins (8 January 1824 &#x2013; 23 September 1889) was an English novelist, playwright, and author of short stories. His best-known works are The Woman in White (1859), No Name (1862), Armadale (1866), and The Moonstone (1868). Collins was born into the family of painter William Collins in London. He received his early education at home from his mother, after which he attended an academy and a private boarding school. He also traveled with his family to Italy and France, and learned the French and Italian languages. He served as a clerk in the firm of the tea merchants Antrobus &amp; Co. His first novel Iolani, or Tahiti as It Was; a Romance, was rejected by publishers in 1845. His next novel, Antonina, was published in 1850. In 1851, he met Charles Dickens, and the two became close friends. A number of Collins' works were first published in Dickens' journals All the Year Round and Household Words. The two collaborated on several dramatic and fictional works, and some of Collins' plays were performed by Dickens' acting company. Collins published his best known works in the 1860s, achieving financial stability and an international reputation. During this time he began suffering from gout and developed an addiction to opium, which he took (in the form of laudanum) for pain. He continued to publish novels and other works throughout the 1870s and '80s, but the quality of his writing declined along with his health. He died in 1889.</p><h2>Maison Lesage: Haute Couture Embroidery</h2><p><p><strong>The definitive monograph on the most luxurious and illustrious Haute Couture embroidery house in the world, featuring specially commissioned photography of Maison Lesage&#x2019;s historic creations.</strong></p><p>The most prestigious Parisian Haute Couture artisans, Maison Lesage has collaborated with the biggest names in fashion, from Chanel, Schiaparelli, and Yves Saint Laurent, to Cristobal Balenciaga, Valentino, and Alexander McQueen.

Either you&#x2019;re a new grandparent, you&#x2019;re about to become one, or you&#x2019;ve been one for a while and you&#x2019;re having so much fun you want to learn more. Trust me&#x2014;you are in one of the most exciting times of your life. Well, once you get past the fact that you&#x2019;re now old enough to be a grandma or grandpa, <i>then </i>the excitement can set in. Chances are you are a part of the baby boomer generation, like I am. If you came along a little later, know this about the folks a few years older than you: we have reluctantly gotten older, and at fifty, sixty, or seventy years of age, we look in the mirror each day and wonder how we turned into our parents, or we look at our peers and wonder how they got so old. Surely <i>we&#x2019;re</i> not that old!</p><p>Because I am smack-dab in the middle of the boomers, I will often refer to my generation in this book, but don&#x2019;t let it stop you from reading if you&#x2019;re not one of us. You are close enough if you have grandchildren&#x2014;plus, there&#x2019;s a lot to learn from our far-out and groovy generation. We, the baby boomers, were born between the years of 1946 and 1964. My youngest sister was born on the same day the Beatles made their American debut on The Ed Sullivan Show. That date was February 9, 1964, which makes her one of the youngest in this boomer generation. It&#x2019;s hard to believe, but that one show set a record with seventy-three million viewers. Seventy-three million! What could a television network possibly do to get seventy-three million viewers? Well, back in those days, they didn&#x2019;t have to do much. We had only three channels. Remember that? With only three choices, odds were in a network&#x2019;s favor that they were going to get plenty of viewers. Still, no one expected the Beatles to draw a crowd of that magnitude.</p><p>Sadly, I was not one of those seventy-three million viewers. Nope, I am forever aware that I missed one of the single most iconic events in American history because my family was busy welcoming baby boomer number six. It was on February 10 that I realized how deprived I had been. I got on the school bus, eager to share news of our precious new bundle of joy, only to be met with excited screams and squeals about the &#x201c;Beagles.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s exactly what my little ten-year-old ears heard. Apparently a new rock band named the &#x201c;Beagles&#x201d; had exploded onto the American music scene, stealing my thunder of having a new sibling. Oh well, it didn&#x2019;t take long for me to get the name straight and join the rest of the world singing &#x201c;I Want to Hold Your Hand&#x201d; and screaming for the Beatles.</p><p>While my little sister is among the last of the baby boomer generation, Phil Robertson, my co-grandparent and star of the reality show <i>Duck Dynasty</i>, was born in 1946, making him one of the first in the generation. It&#x2019;s been interesting to watch this eighteen-year span through the lives of my little sister and Phil Robertson. The eighteen-year difference makes baby boomers very diverse. In fact, if you were to read the facts surrounding Phil&#x2019;s birth and that of my little sister, you would think these two people couldn&#x2019;t possibly be from the same generation, but they are. Here are a few more facts.</p><p>The label <i>baby boomer</i> was given because so many babies were born during the economic boom following World War II. Historian Landon Jones described the trend by saying that almost exactly nine months after World War II ended, &#x201c;the cry of the baby was heard across the land.&#x201d; In fact, more babies were born in 1946 than ever before. And so began the baby boom. The boom finally tapered off after 1964 but not before leaving around seventy-six million of us to make our mark on American history.</p><p>Along with the baby boomer label, we&#x2019;ve been dubbed the TV generation, the rock-and-roll generation, and the buy-it-now-and-use-credit generation. Yes, yes, and yes! We are guilty of being the first generation to sit too close to a new invention called television. Our moms were happy to put us in front of shows like <i>The Mickey Mouse Club</i> and <i>Captain Kangaroo</i>, so we happily obliged them, thus becoming the first generation to be influenced by the media. And yes, we&#x2019;re guilty of listening to rock and roll on our transistor radios and giant stereo systems in our living rooms or blasting out our neighbors from our car radios. This led to other firsts, such as great dances like the Jerk, the Mashed Potato, and the Frug. (The Frug? Seriously?) Okay, I&#x2019;m not so sure the dances were that great. Maybe we should have stuck to the classics, which would have made our parents happy, but that was not the goal of this generation. We were determined to be different. The beehive hairdo was out, and long and straight hair was in. The mellow music of Frank Sinatra was a thing of the past. We wanted it loud, or if it was soft, we wanted it full of deep meaning. And about those credit cards&#x2014;we certainly are guilty of using and abusing that luxury. But hey, it sounded like a good idea at the time, right?</p><p>But we&#x2019;re not a lost cause by any means. Here&#x2019;s one description I read about us that I love. Apparently we&#x2019;re the first generation to use the word <i>retirement </i>to mean &#x201c;get going&#x201d; instead of &#x201c;slow down.&#x201d; In other words, our generation is up and moving in ways past generations were not at our age. We&#x2019;re more likely to go skydiving or join a tennis league or travel the country than sit in a rocking chair. In fact, a study from Bankers Life found that &#x201c;41% of baby boomers still in the workplace expect to work beyond age 69&#x2014;or never retire.&#x201d; This same study revealed that of the baby boomers who are still working, six out of ten work because they want to. Some of the reasons cited were to stay mentally sharp, to be physically active, and to have a sense of purpose. Yep, that&#x2019;s us.</p><p><i>What is wrong with us boomers?</i> you might be asking yourself. Why can&#x2019;t we just sit back and relax and leave things to the next generation? I can&#x2019;t answer that question for you, but I can for myself. I just don&#x2019;t feel as if I&#x2019;m done yet. There&#x2019;s more to see and more to accomplish, and with each day, my time to see and do is drawing to an end. The fact that our generation wants more for ourselves, physically and mentally, means we are increasing our chances of living longer, and that gives us more time to do the things we love. Still, we&#x2019;re very aware of the brevity of our lives on this earth. We might wear skinny jeans, text, work out, or ride a motorcycle, but we know we&#x2019;re not young anymore. Our bodies ache, and it takes us longer to text than a four-year-old, but we&#x2019;re not done yet. We still feel the need to be significant members of modern society.</p><p>So, grandparents, you might still be playing in a band like Paul McCartney or competing in tennis tournaments like Chris Evert, or you might be a strong player in the workforce like Donald Trump, but now you also hold one of the most important titles you will ever hold, and that&#x2019;s <i>Grandma </i>or <i>Grandpa</i>.</p><p>According to the website Grandparents.com, 1.7 million new grandparents are added every year with an overall number of 70 million grandparents in the States today. Wow! And from the posts you put on Facebook, it&#x2019;s clear you think you&#x2019;re the only grandparents in America! I&#x2019;m just kidding. Keep posting those grandkid pics. I&#x2019;m going to. It&#x2019;s part of who we are. That same website says that 75 percent of us are online users. There&#x2019;s no grass growing under our feet. We&#x2019;re going to figure out how to stay connected, aren&#x2019;t we? Even if we have to get our grandkids to connect us and tell us for the tenth time how to use Twitter! (Yes, true confessions from this social media grandma.)</p><p>So here we are. We may not look or act like grandparents of the past, but we are the grandparents for this newest generation. As I said earlier, you might be a grandparent to a newborn, or like me, you may have a grandchild in his or her twenties (how did this happen?). In any case, this is the generation we are charged with affecting. A generation who hasn&#x2019;t been officially dubbed anything. A generation who faces challenges we didn&#x2019;t even know could exist. So the question is, <i>How can we accomplish this?</i> As connected as we try to be, relating to this &#x201c;wired&#x201d; generation will be challenging.</p><p>This younger generation will never know the fun of snuggling with siblings while wearing pajamas at a drive-in movie. Many won&#x2019;t know what it&#x2019;s like to play outside until dark and hear Mom yell, &#x201c;Dinner&#x2019;s ready!&#x201d; They won&#x2019;t experience watching a good western like Bonanza with the whole family in one room. Many of our grandkids will never know the joy and trials of sharing a room with a sibling. No, this new generation has choices and options&#x2014;too many, that&#x2019;s for sure. Too many TV shows, too many pairs of jeans, too many sports or other activities. They are a generation of excess.</p><p>Is there a place for us grandparents in their excessive world? You bet there is! Grandparents are the glue that will hold this world together. My mom is eighty-seven years old and is the reigning matriarch of our family. Until age eighty-four, she worked full time. She is on Facebook, dresses like a movie star, and attends as many grandkid and great-grandkid activities as her busy schedule allows. One day she told me her goal in her later years is to remain relevant. I told her she has achieved that goal. Born in 1931, Mom is part of what has been dubbed the silent generation. The silent generation includes babies born from 1925 to 1945. Some of the descriptors I discovered for the silent generation include <i>enjoy reading, love big-band music, loyal, self-sacrificing, and cautious</i>. My mom has all these traits. But she didn&#x2019;t follow the rocking-chair grandma mold that defines many of her peers. She spent what others consider retirement years active in work, church, and community life. She set the stage for her children as we entered our own grandparenting years. She showed us that a world of possibilities still awaits us even after our children are grown and gone. I have five siblings, and we constantly tell Mom to slow down so we can! So, baby boomers, we can&#x2019;t take all the credit for debunking the rocking-chair grandma mentality. My mom single-handedly took on the challenge.</p><p>One thing our generation loves to boast about is our music. We proudly declare it the best! Join me as we take a look at some of the songs that influenced our generation. Each chapter will be introduced with a song from our era. I know it&#x2019;s an eighteen-year span, but you&#x2019;ll get it. I&#x2019;m sure you didn&#x2019;t realize that many of our generation&#x2019;s favorite songs addressed our grandparenting years. As you were rocking out to the top twenty hits, you weren&#x2019;t thinking about your life as a grandparent. And there&#x2019;s no doubt these artists didn&#x2019;t realize they were speaking about being a grandparent either, but they were. Okay, there was that one song we all sang and loved, and it really was about being old, but we couldn&#x2019;t imagine being that old. Sing it with me: &#x201c;<i>Will you still need me...</i>&#x201d;</p><p>Good job! Seriously, that song was great, but losing our hair or knitting a sweater or anything that went along with old age was not a serious threat when we first heard that song&#x2014;yet! Those things were so far in the future that we laughed about them. We&#x2019;re still laughing. Only now we&#x2019;re laughing because they all came true. I want to say thank you to all the great musical geniuses who helped our generation put our feelings into words. Those words are still influencing our lives.</p><p>Yes, this generation of long-haired, self-centered, bell-bottomed, barefoot, spaced-out, rocking teenagers has finally grown up. Hopefully we&#x2019;ve also grown out of the negative monikers we were given and are proud to be called Grandma and Grandpa. Or is it Nana and Papa? Or Honey and Pa? Or Mimi and Pops? Or Gigi and Big Daddy? Here we go again, being our rebellious selves! Did anyone seriously think we would be happy with the titles <i>Grandma </i>and <i>Grandpa</i>? Nope. Not us. We&#x2019;re way too young for those names!</p><p>I realize that I&#x2019;ve said a lot about baby boomers and that the premise of the book rests on baby boomer songs, but I&#x2019;m aware that many grandparents are a few years short of being a boomer or may have been born a little before this generation. Don&#x2019;t let that stop you from reading this book. It&#x2019;s full of hints, tips, and advice that are good for grandparents of all ages and in all stages.</p><p>So, Nana and Papa or Honey and Pa or Mimi and Pops or Gigi and Big Daddy, hang loose and enjoy the world of grandparenting. Trust me&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a far-out, neato, and groovy place to be! You&#x2019;re well on your way to being a rockstar grandparent to some very special children.</p><p>Hugs,</p><p>Chrys</p></p><h2>Loose Leaf for Math in Our World: A Quantitative Literacy Approach</h2><p>What does quantitative reasoning really mean? Is it just liberal arts math with a new name on the cover of the book? We say that it is not. It&#x2019;s about students productively struggling with context-based problems. It&#x2019;s not just learning how to do math problems, but more importantly learning how quantitative thinking is applied throughout the curriculum, and throughout a lifetime.</p><p>I was born and raised in Cleveland, and started college at Bowling Green State University in 1984 majoring in creative writing. Eleven years later, I walked across the graduation stage to receive a PhD in math, a strange journey indeed. After two years at Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania, I came home to Ohio, accepting a tenure-track job at the Hamilton campus of Miami University. I&#x2019;ve won a number of teaching awards in my career, and while maintaining an active teaching schedule, I now spend an inordinate amount of time writing textbooks and course materials. I&#x2019;ve written or co-authored either seven or twelve textbooks, depending on how you count them, as well as several solutions manuals and interactive CD-ROMS. After many years as developmental math coordinator at Miami Hamilton, I share the frustration that goes along with low pass rates in the developmental math curriculum. Far too many students end up on the classic Jetson&#x2019;s-style treadmill, with the abstract nature of the traditional algebra curriculum keeping them from reaching their goals. Like so many instructors across the country, I believe the time is right to move beyond the one-size-fits-all curriculum that treats students the same whether they hope to be an engineer or a pastry chef. &#x201c;Because we&#x2019;ve always done it that way&#x201d; is NOT a good reason to maintain the status quo in our curriculum. Let&#x2019;s work together to devise alternate pathways that help students to learn more and learn better while hastening their trip into credit-bearing math courses. Since my book (Math in Our World) is written for the Liberal Arts Math and Quantitative Literacy market, I think I&#x2019;m in the right place at the right time to make a difference in the new and exciting pathways course. I&#x2019;m in a very happy place right now: my love of teaching meshes perfectly with my childhood dream of writing. (Don&#x2019;t tell my publisher this &#x2013; they think I spend 20 hours a day working on textbooks &#x2013; but I&#x2019;m working on my first novel in the limited spare time that I have.) I&#x2019;m also a former coordinator of Ohio Project NExT, as I believe very strongly in helping young college instructors focus on high-quality teaching as a primary career goal. I live in Fairfield, Ohio with my lovely wife Cat and fuzzy dogs Macleod and Tessa. When not teaching or writing, my passions include Ohio State football, Cleveland Indians baseball, heavy metal music, travel, golf, and home improvement.<br><br>I can say without a doubt that I was made to be in a classroom. I followed the footsteps of my father, a 35-year middle school math teaching veteran, into this challenging yet rewarding career. My college experience began as a community college student at Lakeland College in Mattoon, Illinois. From there, I received a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Eastern Illinois University and a Master of Science in Mathematics from Southern Illinois University. I accepted a tenure-track faculty position at Parkland College, where I have taught developmental and college-level courses for 15 years. I had the opportunity to begin writing textbooks shortly after I started teaching at Parkland. My then department chair and mentor, James W. Hall, and I co-authored several textbooks in Beginning and Intermediate Algebra. In the fall of 2011, our department began discussing the idea of creating two tracks through our beginning and intermediate algebra courses. The idea stemmed from two issues. First, most of our beginning and intermediate algebra students were headed to either our Liberal Arts Math or our Introduction to Statistics course. Second, we wanted to beef up intermediate algebra to better prepare those students who were headed to college algebra. These were two competing ideas! Increasing the algebraic rigor of these courses seemed to &#x201c;punish&#x201d; students who were not heading to college algebra. With the two track system, we implemented a solution that best serves both groups of students. I have to admit that I was initially concerned that offering an alternate path through developmental mathematics for students not planning to take college algebra would lead to a lowering of standards. However, my participation in our committee investigating this idea led me to believe it was possible to offer a rigorous course that was exceedingly more appropriate for this group of students. Since there were no materials for the course, I began creating my own and was paired by McGraw Hill with Dave Sobecki. Together, we have created the material that I have been using for class testing. After a semester and a half of piloting these materials and seeing the level of enthusiasm and engagement in the mathematical conversations of my students, I am now convinced that this is an ideal course to refine and offer. As a trusted colleague told me, &#x201c;this is just a long overdue idea.&#x201d; Outside of the classroom and away from the computer, I am kept educated, entertained and ever-busy my wonderful wife, Nikki, and our two children, Charlotte, 6 and Jake, 5. I am an avid St. Louis Cardinals fan and enjoy playing recreational softball and golf in the summertime with colleagues and friends.</p><h2>Petals of Blood</h2><p><b>&#x201c;The definitive African book of the twentieth century<b>&#x201d;</b> (Moses Isegawa, from the Introduction) by the Nobel Prize&#x2013;nominated Kenyan writer</b><br><br>The puzzling murder of three African directors of a foreign-owned brewery sets the scene for this fervent, hard-hitting novel about disillusionment in independent Kenya. A deceptively simple tale, <i>Petals of Blood</i>&nbsp;is on the surface a suspenseful investigation of a spectacular triple murder in upcountry Kenya. Yet as the intertwined stories of the four suspects unfold, a devastating picture emerges of a modern third-world nation whose frustrated people feel their leaders have failed them time after time. <br><br>First published in 1977, this novel was so explosive that its author was imprisoned without charges by the Kenyan government. His incarceration was so shocking that newspapers around the world called attention to the case, and protests were raised by human-rights groups, scholars, and writers, including James Baldwin, Toni Morrison, Donald Barthelme, Harold Pinter, and Margaret Drabble.</p><p><b>Ngugi&nbsp;wa Thiong&#x2019;o</b> was born in Limuru, Kenya, in 1938.

He had just returned from a night&#x2019;s vigil on the mountain. He was resting on his bed, Bible open at the Book of Revelation, when two police constables, one tall, the other short, knocked at the door.</p><p>&#x2018;Are you Mr Munira?&#x2019; the short one asked. He had a star-shaped scar above the left brow.</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You teach at the New Ilmorog Primary School?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;And where do you think you are now standing?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Ah, yes. We try to be very sure. Murder, after all, is not irio or ugali.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What are you talking about?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You are wanted at the New Ilmorog Police Station.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;About?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Murder, of course &#x2013; murder in Ilmorog.&#x2019;</p><p>The tall one who so far had not spoken hastened to add: &#x2018;It is nothing much, Mr Munira. Just routine questioning.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t explain. You are only doing your duty in this world. But let me put on my coat.&#x2019;</p><p>They looked at one another, surprised at his cool reception of the news. He came back carrying the Holy Book in one hand.</p><p>&#x2018;You never leave the Book behind, Mr Munira,&#x2019; said the short one, impressed, and a little fearful of the Book&#x2019;s power.</p><p>&#x2018;We must always be ready to plant the seed in these last days before His second coming. All the signs &#x2013; strife, killing, wars, blood &#x2013; are prophesied here.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;How long have you been in Ilmorog?&#x2019; asked the tall one, to change the subject from this talk of the end of the world and Christ&#x2019;s second coming. He was a regular churchgoer and did not want to be caught on the wrong side.</p><p>&#x2018;You have already started your routine questions, eh?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No, no, this is off the record, Mr Munira. It is just conversation.

He looked at his bandaged left hand. He had not been kept long at the hospital. He felt strangely calm after the night&#x2019;s ordeal. But he still could not understand what had really happened. Maybe in time, he thought &#x2013; but would he ever be able to explain this fulfilment of what had only been a wish, an intention? How far had he willed it? He raised his head and saw a police constable looking at him.</p><p>&#x2018;Abdulla?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I am a policeman on duty.

They want you to record a statement and to answer a few questions.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s all right. Let me put this chair back inside the house.&#x2019;</p><p>But at the station they locked him up in a cell. Abdulla protested against the deception. A policeman slapped him on the face. One day, one day, he tried to say in sudden resurgence of old anger and new bitterness at the latest provocation.</p><p>3 ~ A police officer went to the hospital where Wanja had been admitted.</p><p>&#x2018;I am afraid you cannot see her,&#x2019; said the doctor. &#x2018;She is not in a position to answer questions.

He heard a knock at the door. He leapt out of bed in his pyjamas. He found a heavily armed police contingent at the door. An officer in khaki clothes stepped forward.</p><p>&#x2018;What is the matter?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You are wanted at the police station.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What for?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Routine questioning.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Can&#x2019;t it wait until tomorrow?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I am afraid not.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Let me change into something . . .&#x2019;</p><p>He went back and changed. He wondered how he would contact the others. He had listened to the six o&#x2019;clock news and so he knew that the strike had been banned. But he hoped that even if he was arrested, the strike would go on.</p><p>He was hurled into a waiting Land Rover, and driven off.</p><p>Akinyi, preparing to go to Ilmorog Church for the morning service, happened to look in the direction of his house. She always did this, automatically, and she had promised herself to cut out the habit. She saw the Land Rover drive away. She rushed to his place &#x2013; she had never been there &#x2013; and found the door padlocked.</p><p>Within a few hours word had spread. The workers, in a hostile mood, marched toward the police station demanding his release. A police officer came out and spoke to them in a surprisingly conciliatory manner.</p><p>&#x2018;Please disband peacefully. Karega is here for routine questioning. And it is not about your last night&#x2019;s decision to take a strike action. It&#x2019;s about murder &#x2013; murder in Ilmorog.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Murder of the workers!&#x2019; somebody retorted.</p><p>&#x2018;Murder of the workers&#x2019; movement!&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Long live the workers&#x2019; struggle!&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Please disband&#x2014;&#x2019; appealed the officer, desperately.</p><p>&#x2018;Disband yourself . . . disband the tyranny of foreign companies and their local messengers!&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Out with foreign rule policed by colonized blackskins! Out with exploitation of our sweat!&#x2019;</p><p>The crowd was getting into an angry, threatening mood. He signalled his lieutenants. They called out others who came with guns and chased the protesting workers right to the centre of Ilmorog. One or two workers sustained serious injuries and were taken to hospital.</p><p>Workers were waking to their own strength. Such a defiant confrontation with authority had never before happened in Ilmorog.</p><p>5 ~ One newspaper, the Daily Mouthpiece, brought out a special issue with a banner headline: MZIGO, CHUI, KIMERIA MURDERED.</p><p>A man, believed to be a trade-union agitator, has been held after a leading industrialist and two educationists, well known as the African directors of the internationally famous Theng&#x2019;eta Breweries and Enterprises Ltd, were last night burnt to death in Ilmorog, only hours after taking a no-nonsense-no-pay-rise decision.</p><p>It is believed that they were lured into a house where they were set on by hired thugs.</p><p>The three will be an irreplaceable loss to Ilmorog. They built Ilmorog from a tiny nineteenth-century village reminiscent of the days of Krapf and Rebman into a modern industrial town that even generations born after Gagarin and Armstrong will be proud to visit . . . etc . . . etc . . . Kimeria and Chui were prominent and founding fathers of KCO . . . etc . . . etc . . .</p><p><b>Chapter Two</b></p><p>1 ~ But all that was twelve years after Godfrey Munira, a thin dustcloud trailing behind him, first rode a metal horse through Ilmorog to the door of a moss-grown two-roomed house in what was once a schoolyard. He got off and stood still, his right hand akimbo, his left holding the horse, his reddish lined eyes surveying the grey, dry lichen on a once white-ochred wall. Then, unhurriedly, he leaned the metal horse against the wall and, bending down, unclipped loose the trouser bottoms, beat them a little with his hands &#x2013; a symbolic gesture, since the dust stubbornly clung to them and to his shoes &#x2013; before moving back a few steps to re-survey the door, the falling-apart walls and the sun-rotted tin roof. Suddenly, determinedly, he strode to the door and tried the handle while pushing the door with his right shoulder. He crashed through into a room full of dead spiders and the wings of flies on cobwebs on all the walls, up to the eaves.</p><p>Another one has come into the village, went the news in Ilmorog. Children spied on him, on his frantic efforts to trim up and weed the place, and they reported everything to the old men and women. He would go away with the wind, said the elderly folk: had there not been others before him? Who would want to settle in this wasteland except those without limbs &#x2013; may the devil swallow Abdulla &#x2013; and those with aged loins &#x2013; may the Lord bless Nyakinyua, the old woman.</p><p>The school itself was a four-roomed barrack with broken mud walls, a tin roof with gaping holes and more spiders&#x2019; webs and the wings and heads of dead flies. Was it any wonder that teachers ran away at the first glance? The pupils were mostly shepherd boys, who often did not finish a term but followed their fathers in search of new pastures and water for their cattle.</p><p>But Munira stayed on, and after a month we were all whispering &#x2013; was he a little crazed &#x2013; and he not so old? Was he a carrier of evil? &#x2014; especially when he started holding classes under the acacia bush near the place rumoured to be the grave of the legendary Ndemi, whose spirit once kept watch over Ilmorog Country before imperialism came and changed the scheme of things. He is mocking Ndemi, said Mwathi wa Mugo, who divined for both the ridge and the plains and prescribed a deterrent. At night, under the cover of darkness, the old woman shat a mountain between the school building and the acacia bush. In the morning the children found a not-so-dry mound of shit. They ran back to their parents and told a funny story about the new teacher. For a week or so Munira galloped his horse the length of the hills and plains in pursuit of the disappearing pupils. He caught up with one. He got off his horse, letting it fall to the ground, and ran after the pupil.</p><p>&#x2018;What is your name?&#x2019; he asked, holding him by the shoulder.</p><p>&#x2018;Muriuki.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Son of?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Wambui.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s your mother?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What about your father?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;He works far away.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Tell me: why don&#x2019;t you like school?&#x2019;</p><p>The boy was drawing marks on the ground with his right toe, head bent to one side, holding back laughter with difficulty.</p><p>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know, I don&#x2019;t know,&#x2019; he said, making as if to cry. Munira let him go after getting a promise that Muriuki would return and even bring the others. So they came back cautiously: they still thought him a bit odd and this time would not venture out of the closed walls.</p><p>She waited for Munira outside the school kei-apple hedge. He got off the metal horse. He stood aside, thinking she only wanted to pass. But she stood in the middle of the narrow track supporting herself against a twigged stick.</p><p>&#x2018;Where you come from: are there tarmac roads?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;And light that comes from wires on dry trees to make day out of night?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Women in high heels?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Oiled hair, singed goatskin smell?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>He looked at her furrowed face, at the light in her eyes. His own wandered past her, over the empty school, for it was after four o&#x2019;clock, and he thought: what did she want?</p><p>&#x2018;They are beautiful and wise in the ways of the white man: is this not so?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;That they are: too wise, sometimes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Our young men and women have left us. The glittering metal has called them. They go, and the young women only return now and then to deposit the newborn with their grandmothers already aged with scratching this earth for a morsel of life. They say: there in the city there is room for only one . . . our employers, they don&#x2019;t want babies about the tiny rooms in tiny yards. Have you ever heard of that? Unwanted children? The young men also. Some go and never return. Others sometimes come to see the wives they left behind, make them round-bellied, and quickly go away as if driven from Ilmorog by Uhere or Mutung&#x2019;u. What should we call them? The new Uhere and Mutung&#x2019;u generation: for was it not the same skin diseases and plagues that once in earlier times weakened our people in face of the Mzungu invasion? Tell me: what then brings you to a deserted homestead? Look at Abdulla. He came from over there and what did he bring us? A donkey. Now imagine, a donkey! What have you really come to fetch from our village? Is it the remaining children?&#x2019;</p><p>He pondered this a few seconds. He plucked a ripened yellow kei-apple and crushed it between his fingers: isn&#x2019;t there a safe corner in which to hide and do some work, plant a seed whose fruits one could see? The smell from the rotting fermenting kei-apple hit into his nostrils. He felt a sudden nausea, Lord deliver us from our past, and frantically fumbled in his pockets for a handkerchief to cover the sneeze. It was too late. A bit of mucus flew onto the woman&#x2019;s furrowed face. She shrieked out, auuu-u, Nduri ici mutiuke muone, and fled in fright. He turned his face aside to hold back another sneeze. When a second later he looked to the path, he could not find a trace of her behind the kei-apple bush or anywhere. She had vanished.</p><p>Strange, mysterious, he muttered to himself. He got on his metal horse and slowly rode toward Abdulla&#x2019;s shop.</p><p>Abdulla was also a newcomer to Ilmorog. He and little skinny Joseph had come into our midst in a donkey-cart full of an assortment of sufurias and plates and cheap blankets tightly packed into torn sisal sacks and dirty sheets knotted into temporary bags. This was going to be an eventful year, Njogu had exclaimed sarcastically on seeing the odd trio, and listening to their even more odd request: how in this desert place could anyone even think of rescuing the broken mud-walled shop that had once belonged to Dharamashah of Ilmorog legends? You can take the ghost . . . memories, curses and all . . . old Njogu had said, pointing to the building, whose roof and walls leaned to one side and looked indistinguishable from the dry weed and the red earth. We used to crowd his little shop and look curiously at his stumped leg and his miserable face and listen to his stream of curses at Joseph. Soon we were glad that at long last we had a place from which we could get salt and pepper. But we were rather alarmed at his donkey because it ate too much grass and drank too much water. Within a month Abdulla had added bar services to his supply of Jogoo Unga and pepper and salt.

Epic Wanderer, the first full-length biography of David Thompson, is set in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries against a broad canvas of dramatic rivalries -- between the United States and British North America, between the Hudson&#39;s Bay Company and its Montreal-based rival, the North West Co., and between the various First Nations thrown into disarray by the advent of guns, horses and alcohol. Less celebrated than his contemporaries Lewis and Clark, Thompson spent nearly three decades (1784-1812) surveying and mapping over 1.2 million square miles of largely uncharted Indian territory. Travelling across the prairies, over the Rockies and on to the Pacific, Thompson transformed the raw data of his explorations into a map of the Canadian West. Measuring ten feet by seven feet, and laid out with astonishing accuracy, the map became essential to the politicians and diplomats who would decide upon the future of the rich and promising lands of the West. Yet its creator worked without personal glory and died in penniless obscurity. Drawing extensively on David Thompson&#39;s personal journals, illustrated with his detailed sketches, intricate notebook pages and the map itself, Epic Wanderer charts the life of a man who risked everything in the name of scientific advancement and exploration.</p><p>Epic Wanderer, the first full-length biography of mapmaker David Thompson (1770&#x2013;1857), is set in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries against the broad canvas of dramatic rivalries between the United States and British North America, between the Hudson&#x2019;s Bay Company and its Montreal-based rival, the North West Company, and among the various First Nations thrown into disarray by the advent of guns, horses, and alcohol. <p>Less celebrated than his contemporaries Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, Thompson spent nearly three decades, beginning in 1784, surveying and mapping more than 1.2 million square miles of largely uncharted Indian territory.

But recently scientists have identified another seriously endangered ecosystem: coral reefs. In Corals in Space and Time, J. E. N. Veron provides a richly detailed study of corals that will inform investigations of these fragile ecosystems.<br>Drawing on twenty-five years of research, Veron brings together extensive field observations about the taxonomy, biogeography, paleontology, and biology of corals. After introducing coral taxonomy and biogeography, as well as relevant aspects of coral biology for the non-specialist, he provides an interpretation of the fossil record and paleoclimates, an analysis of modern coral distribution, and a discussion of the evolutionary nature and origins of coral species.<br>Revealing a sharp conflict between empirical observations about the geographical variation within species, Veron introduces a non-Darwinian theory of coral evolution. He proposes that the evolution of coral species is driven not primarily by natural selection, but by constantly shifting patterns of ocean circulation, which produce changing variations of genetic connectivity. This mechanism of speciation and hybridization has far-reaching consequences for the study of all types of corals and potentially many other groups of organisms as well.</p><p>J. E. N.

When his brother, the mayor, conspires with local politicians and the newspaper to suppress the story, Stockmann appeals to the public meeting&#x2014;only to be shouted down and reviled as 'an enemy of the people'. Ibsen's explosive play reveals his distrust of politicians and the blindly held prejudices of the 'solid majority'.</p><p><p><b>Arthur Miller</b> (1915-2005) was born in New York City and studied at the University of Michigan.

Perhaps it is because we can feel the direct link to our past that no history book, no movie, no historical fantasy can ever convey. These stones and these unkempt grounds are the hard evidence of lives that came before us. Once, these people lived and breathed, loved, worked, fought, hoped and despaired, and experienced their triumphs and failures just as we do today. And, although we seldom care to acknowledge it, we will inevitably go where they have gone."&#x2015;from the Preface</p><p>For the many people who enjoy walking through old cemeteries, exploring forgotten and overgrown graveyards, and reading the names, dates, and epitaphs of the dead, the Chesapeake Bay region offers a rich assortment of final resting places, many dating back to the early 1600s. From Williamsburg to Havre de Grace, it is not uncommon to see a number of the living wandering among the markers of the dead. Some are genealogists and historians, others come in search of quietude and a tangible connection to the past.</p><p>In <i>The Chesapeake Book of the Dead</i>, Helen Chappell and photographer Starke Jett survey this rich legacy, from the vast and imposing Arlington National Cemetery to lone graves so modest as to have been lost almost as soon as they were dug. Chappell and Jett visit graveyards of the famous and the obscure, wander through cemeteries dotted with both elaborate funerary and simple, weather-beaten headstones, and discover epitaphs that range from the literary to the amusing to the poignant. As old grave sites disappear under developers' bulldozers, through neglect, and at the hands of unscrupulous headstone collectors, this remarkable book offers a unique and elegiac look at our past and its tales of love and tragedy.</p><p>Among the cemeteries explored are Southeast Washington's Congressional Cemetery (posthumous home to composer John Philip Sousa, FBI head J. Edgar Hoover, pioneering feminist and muckraking journalist Anne Royall, and Choctaw chief and notable military tactician Pushmataha); Baltimore's Green Mount Cemetery (built in the 1830s as Baltimore's first sylvan graveyard); and Westminster Burying Ground in downtown Baltimore. At Westminster lies the grave of Edgar Allan Poe, which a mysterious figure visits each year on Poe's birthday to leave roses and a bottle of brandy. The book also describes the final resting places for such celebrities as Dorothy Parker (Chappell located her ashes at the NAACP headquarters in Baltimore), F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald (buried in Rockville at Scott's wish, because, he insisted, "I belong here," in Maryland, "where everything is civilized and gay and rotted and polite"), and cosmopolitan actress Tallulah Bankhead (interred in a plot her sister provided near Chestertown).</p><p>Included throughout this fascinating book are essays on mourning fashion and deathbed performances, graveyard ghost stories, discussions of efforts to save historic cemeteries, and notes from the diary of a nineteenth-century doctor who today is buried in Rising Sun Cemetery alongside many of his patients. Chappell's lively prose, accompanied by Jett's haunting black-and-white photographs, will delight all those drawn to the seclusion, peacefulness, and melancholy of old graveyards.</p><p>Jacket illustration: Lower Hooper's Island, Maryland </p></p><p><p>From the author of The Oysterback Tales, a unique and elegiac look at the region's past and its tales of love and tragedy, loss and remembrance. </p><p>Writer <b>Helen Chappell,</b> a columnist for the <i>Tidewater Times</i> and frequent contributor to the <i>Baltimore Sun</i> and the <i>Washington Post</i>, is the author of numerous books, including <i>The Oysterback Tales</i>, also available from Johns Hopkins, and <i>Oysterback Spoken Here</i>, as well as the Sam Wescott-Hollis Ball mystery series, of which <i>Give Up the Ghost</i> is the most recent example.

Urged to tell what he was seeing through the small opening he had cut in the door to the tomb, the Egyptologist famously replied, &#x201c;I see wonderful things.&#x201d; Carter&#x2019;s fabulous discovery is just one of the many spellbinding stories told in <i>Three Stones Make a Wall</i>. Written by Eric Cline, an archaeologist with more than thirty seasons of excavation experience, this book traces the history of archaeology from an amateur pursuit to the cutting-edge science it is today by taking the reader on a tour of major archaeological sites and discoveries. Along the way, it addresses the questions archaeologists are asked most often: How do you know where to dig? How are excavations actually done? How do you know how old something is? Who gets to keep what is found? Taking readers from the pioneering digs of the eighteenth century to today&#x2019;s exciting new discoveries, <i>Three Stones Make a Wall</i> is a lively and essential introduction to the story of archaeology.</p><p><p>"This book takes your hand and leads you on a magical archaeology mystery tour across the globe. You'll meet famous archaeologists, explore legendary sites, and see the latest discoveries using new technologies. Archaeology is full of 'wonderful things, ' and <i>Three Stones Make a Wall</i>, written by one of its greatest storytellers, is a must-have."<b>--Sarah Parcak, University of Alabama at Birmingham, winner of the 2016 TED Prize</b></p><p>"Eric Cline takes the reader on an amazing journey through the history of archaeology, essentially allowing us to walk in the boots of archaeologists at the moment of the greatest discoveries of all time.

For those firefighters and company officers assigned to a Rapid Intervention Team (RIT), not making the correct split-second decisions--such as immediately recognizing changes in fire behavior or failing to evaluate their level of SCBA air--can result in the loss of the lives of the entire team. In an effort to reduce the number of line-of-duty firefighting injuries and deaths, while at the same time being proactive in the fire service training and leadership, authors Richard Kolomay and Robert Hoff have drawn upon their combined 50+ years of firefighting experience to put together this comprehensive guide.<br> <br> Key Features &amp; Benefits<br> - Provides an awareness of firefighter safety and proactive fire service training<br> - Describes various types of serious firefighter injuries and fatality incidents during emergency incident operations<br> - Details recommended Rapid Intervention Team operating methods and procedures, as well as how to activate a Rapid Intervention Team</p><p>Rick Kolomay is a 24-year veteran of the fire service. He is an Illinois state certified field instructor with the Illinois Fire Service Institute and was awarded 2002 Instructor of the Year by the Illinois Society of Fire Service Instructors. He holds an associate's degree in science and bachelor's degree from Southern Illinois University. He has instructed for several community colleges, the Chicago Fire Academy, and Illinois Fire Chief's Association. As a past full-time instructor for the Illinois Fire Service Institute, he instituted one of the first nationally recognized hands-on training company officer courses.&nbsp;<br> Bob Hoff is a battalion chief with the Chicago Fire Department and part-time captain of the Evergreen Park (IL) Fire Department. Previously, Hoff served two years as director of training operations at the Chicago Fire Academy, then citywide relief for ten years as a battalion chief.

Written over a span of twenty-one years, these essays cover an extraordinarily broad range of films&#x2015;from Hollywood blockbusters to foreign art movies to experimental cinema. They include not just reviews but perceptive commentary on directors, actors, and trends; and thoughtful analysis of the practice of film criticism.<br><br>It is this last element&#x2015;Rosenbaum's reflections on the art of film criticism&#x2015;that sets this collection apart from other volumes of film writing. Both in the essays themselves and in the section introductions, Rosenbaum provides a rare insider's view of his profession: the backstage politics, the formulation of critical judgments, the function of film commentary. Taken together, these pieces serve as a guided tour of the profession of film criticism.<br><br>They also serve as representative samples of Rosenbaum's unique brand of film writing. Among the highlights are memoirs of director Jacques Tati and maverick critic Manny Farber, celebrations of classics such as <i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</i> and <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i>, and considered reevaluations of Orson Welles and Woody Allen.</p><p>"Once or twice a generation a film critic comes along who expands or even redefines how we talk about the medium.

Herbs containing constituents called cardiac glycosides are used worldwide for treating heart failure and arrhythmias. These herbs help strengthen the heartbeat and normalize its rate. Foxglove is the source of the widely used medication digoxin, which contains stimulating digitalis glycosides. However, herbal remedies nurture the heart in deeper ways as well. The cardiovascular tonics offer a range of remedies uniquely suited for treating problems of the heart and blood vessels. While they cannot boast the dramatic, rapid, often lifesaving effects of many of the synthetic drugs on the market today, they have a definite advantage in addressing the chronic degenerative conditions often found among people as they age. <br> <br><b>CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS <br></b> <br><b>Hypertension </b> <br>There are more than thirty-five million hypertensives in the United States. Twice as many African Americans as Caucasians are afflicted, but the reasons for this are not understood. A common problem in our culture, hypertension (or high blood pressure) is rare in cultures that are relatively untouched by the Western lifestyle. Lifestyle plays a major role in causing and maintaining hypertension. Dietary, psychological, and social factors must all be addressed for any real change to occur. <br> <br>Hypertension is typically free of symptoms until complications arise. The symptoms associated with the condition can be caused by other problems as well and include dizziness, flushed face, headache, fatigue, nosebleed, and nervousness. Observable changes in retinal blood vessels are diagnostic indicators of the degree of damage caused to the body by hypertension. Diagnosis includes finding that both systolic and diastolic blood pressure are usually, but not always, higher than normal; other causes must be excluded. Hypertension is considered to be shown by a blood pressure reading of greater than 140/90, but &#x201c;normal&#x201d; must be considered as a range rather than as one specific figure for the whole population. <br> <br>Temporary increase in blood pressure is a common and normal response to the ups and downs of life. Sustained hypertension is caused by increased peripheral vascular resistance. This is initiated by increased arteriolar tone and leads to the damaging structural changes of arteriosclerosis. <br> <br>A number of herbs have a reputation as being specific for hypertension, usually because of their impact on one or another of the processes involved in the condition&#x2019;s development. The hypotensives, remedies that have been found by generations of herbalists to reduce elevated blood pressure, fit this description. The most important such plant remedy known to Western medicine is hawthorn, but there are many more. Included here is a partial list: <br> <br>black cohosh <br>black haw <br>blue cohosh <br>buckwheat <br>cramp bark <br>eleuthero <br>fenugreek <br>garlic <br>hawthorn berries <br>linden <br>mistletoe <br>motherwort <br>nettle <br>onion <br>parsley <br>passionflower <br>skullcap <br>valerian <br>vervain <br>yarrow (European) <br> <br>Each of these hypotensives has other effects that are known as secondary actions; thus the herbalist can select remedies that address the individual&#x2019;s range of needs, not merely the hypertension. Following is a selection of safe and effective hypotensives grouped by their other actions. <br> <br>ï¿½ Adaptogen: Eleuthero <br>ï¿½ Anti-inflammatory: black cohosh, blue cohosh, buckwheat, valerian <br>ï¿½ Antispasmodic: black cohosh, cramp bark, linden, motherwort,passionflower, skullcap, valerian <br>ï¿½ Bitter: yarrow <br>ï¿½ Carminative: parsley, valerian <br>ï¿½ Demulcent: fenugreek <br>ï¿½ Diaphoretic: garlic, linden, onion, vervain, yarrow <br>ï¿½ Diuretic: linden, nettle, parsley, yarrow <br>ï¿½ Expectorant: fenugreek, garlic, onion, parsley <br>ï¿½ Hepatic: onion, vervain <br>ï¿½ Nervine: black cohosh, cramp bark, linden, motherwort, passionflower, skullcap, valerian, vervain <br> <br>Where hypertension is associated with water retention, more emphasis will be placed upon the diuretic herbs listed above; where stress is a major factor, consider the adaptogens and nervines, and so forth. Here is a safe and effective sample combination that will gradually normalize the blood pressure: <br> <br>ï¿½ hawthorn - 2 parts <br>ï¿½ linden blossom -1 part <br>ï¿½ yarrow - 1 part <br>ï¿½ cramp bark - 1 part <br>ï¿½ valerian - 1 part <br>As tincture: take 1 tsp (5 ml) of this mixture three times a day. <br>As dried herb: infuse 2 tsp to a cup and drink three times a day. <br> <br>The ingredients in this mixture are all hypotensives but also offer a well-rounded range of relevant secondary actions. Hawthorn is also an excellent cardiac tonic and thus plays a fundamental role in strengthening and toning the whole cardiovascular system. Diuretics such as yarrow help remove any excessive buildup of water in the body and overcome any decrease in renal blood flow that may accompany the hypertension. Peripheral vasodilators will lessen high resistance within the peripheral blood vessels, thus increasing the total volume of the system and so lowering the pressure within it. The nervines valerian, linden, and cramp bark address any tension and anxiety present. Antispasmodics will ease peripheral resistance to blood flow by gently relaxing both the muscles that the vessels pass through and the muscular coat of the vessels themselves. Cramp bark is probably the most effective and safe of these herbs; valerian is a second. <br> <br>Other plants might be added as well, depending upon the individual&#x2019;s specific symptom picture. For example, if palpitations are present, add motherwort. If stress is a factor, increase the nervine content and possibly include an adaptogen.

By 1492 the Jewish people had become a small group of literate urbanites specializing in crafts, trade, moneylending, and medicine in hundreds of places across the Old World, from Seville to Mangalore. What caused this radical change? <i>The Chosen Few </i>presents a new answer to this question by applying the lens of economic analysis to the key facts of fifteen formative centuries of Jewish history. Maristella Botticini and Zvi Eckstein offer a powerful new explanation of one of the most significant transformations in Jewish history while also providing fresh insights into the growing debate about the social and economic impact of religion.</p></p><p><p>"Maristella Botticini and Zvi Eckstein have written a remarkably interesting book with a new hypothesis about the occupational structure of the Jews. The authors adduce serious evidence for their hypothesis, which lays stress on the requirement introduced nearly 2,000 years ago for universal male literacy among the Jews. This is a fascinating and persuasive combination of history and economics, worth reading by all, even the unhappy few who like neither history nor economics."<b>--Stanley Fischer, governor of the Bank of Israel</b></p><p>"<i>The Chosen Few</i> is a masterpiece: an ambitious, informed, and inspirational reinterpretation of Jewish social and economic history."<b>--Avner Greif, Stanford University</b></p><p>"In this bracing work of economic history, Maristella Botticini and Zvi Eckstein demonstrate how literacy and contract law combined to give Jews a competitive advantage in urbanizing societies. Sure to generate controversy, <i>The Chosen Few</i> takes on one of the truly big questions in Jewish history and sheds intriguing new light on it."<b>--David Biale, University of California, Davis</b></p><p>"Botticini and Eckstein are changing the way economic historians think about Jewish history, and this seminal book will also change the way historians, Jewish studies scholars, and general readers think about the subject. Indeed, the importance of this book can scarcely be exaggerated. An excellent example of economic history that is accessible to general readers, <i>The Chosen Few</i> makes a compelling case for an exciting new perspective that will inspire much further research and be the focus of attention for years to come."<b>--Carmel Chiswick, George Washington University</b></p><p>"This is a mature, original, and significant new attempt to answer one of the most vexing problems in Jewish and economic history. For the general reader it provides an incisive view of the salient facts of Jewish economic history. For the economic historian it opens up a challenging new thesis.

Although Halliday and Resnick's book was the textbook chosen by the Physics Department, many students were observed by the faculty to be studying from Serway's book. The students had acquired old used versions of the Serway book, and they were actively studying out of this book rather than the prescribed textbook. Serway's book became our students' popular choice. The Physics Department, recognizing this, adopted a "give them what they want" attitude, and accordingly Serway's book was made the textbook for the calculus-based undergraduate physics course."<br><br>"Some of the general things I look for are the end-of-chapter questions and problems, and the quality of explanations.

These lectures, Mr. Bernstein&#x2019;s most recent venture in musical explication, will make fascinating reading as well. Virgil Thomson says of the lectures: &#x201c;Nobody anywhere presents this material so warmly, so sincerely, so skillfully. As musical mind-openers they are first class; as pedagogy they are matchless.&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Bernstein considers music ranging from Hindu ragas through Mozart and Ravel, to Copland, suggesting a worldwide, innate musical grammar. Folk music, pop songs, symphonies, modal, tonal, atonal, well-tempered and ill-tempered works all find a place in these discussions. Each, Mr. Bernstein suggests, has roots in a universal language central to all artistic creation. Using certain linguistic analogies, he explores the ways in which this language developed and can be understood as an aesthetic surface. Drawing on his insights as a master composer and conductor, Mr. Bernstein also explores what music means below the surface: the symbols and metaphors which exist in every musical piece, of whatever sort. And, finally, Mr. Bernstein analyzes twentieth century crises in the music of Schoenberg and Stravinsky, finding even here a transformation of all that has gone before, as part of the poetry of expression, through its roots in the earth of human experience.</p><p>These talks, written and delivered when Leonard Bernstein was Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University, are the newest of the author&#x2019;s literary achievements. In addition to a distinguished career as conductor, pianist, and composer, Mr. Bernstein is the recipient of many television Emmys for the scripts of his Young People&#x2019;s Concerts, Omnibus programs, and others, and is the author of <i>The Infinite Variety of Music</i> and <i>The Joy of Music</i>, for which he received the Christopher Award.</p></p><p>Leonard Bernstein&#39;s Norton Lectures on the future course of music drew cheers from his Harvard audiences and television viewers.

By making Cloyster a mild, affable young man of the sort so familiar in his later novels, Wodehouse creates a comic disparity between the character&#x2019;s lofty professions of virtue and his unscrupulous behaviour. As the story progresses, we realise that he is not unusual: all the main characters are unscrupulous in one way or another, ready to cheat and lie in pursuit of their ends, hence the title of the book.<br><br><i>Not George Washington </i>contains many fine scenes, and Cloyster&#x2019;s narrative displays the calm mastery of story-telling Wodehouse had already made his own. If awkwardly executed, it is cleverly plotted, springing several surprises along the way. Clearly autobiographical in origin, it also invites readers to reflect on the nature of talent, fame, failure and success, villainy and honour - themes which continued to recur in the author&#x2019;s work for another sixty years.</p><p>Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (P. G. Wodehouse) was an English humorist and writer best known for his Jeeves and Blandings Castle novels. Educated at boarding schools, Wodehouse turned to writing at a young age, demonstrating great skill at humorous sketches and musical lyrics. He continued to write part-time while pursuing, at the behest of his father, a career in banking, and successfully contributed numerous pieces to Punch, Vanity Fair, and The Daily Express, among other publications. In addition to his literary work, Wodehouse was incorporated into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in recognition of his collaboration with Cole Porter on Anything Goes, his lyrics to the song Bill from Show Boat, and his work on the musicals Rosalie and The Three Musketeers.<p>While interned along with other British citizens in Germany during the Second World War, Wodehouse made a series of radio broadcasts for which he was accused of being a collaborator; and, although later cleared of the charges, he never returned to England. His work has influenced many other writers including Evelyn Waugh, Rudyard Kipling, J. K. Rowling, and John Le Carr?. P. G. Wodehouse died in 1975 at the age of 93.</p>First published in England in 1907, Not George Washington never appeared here in any form until now. And with good reason. It's a dreadful novel, beginning with its odd title. Told through several narrative voices, it's a dreary tale of a young Londoner struggling to make his fortune as a writer so he can marry his true love. Anyone reading this clunker will find it hard to believe it was coauthored by the creator of such brilliant characters as Emsworth, Psmith, and Wooster. Its chief interest lies in its use of some of Wodehouse's own early publishing experiences. Frederick Davidson's reading is a heroic effort to pump life into the book, but the patient was already dead on its belated arrival in America. Recommended only to libraries whose patrons insist (and loudly) on listening to everything Wodehouse ever wrote (cf., Cocktail Time, Audio Reviews, LJ 4/15/97, or Psmith in the City, Audio Reviews, LJ 1/98).?R.

Traditionally, the only topology an undergraduate might see is point-set topology at a fairly abstract level. The next course the average stuï¿½ dent would take would be a graduate course in algebraic topology, and such courses are commonly very homological in nature, providing quick access to current research, but not developing any intuition or geometric sense. I have tried in this text to provide the undergraduate with a pragmatic introduction to the field, including a sampling from point-set, geometric, and algebraic topology, and trying not to include anything that the student cannot immediately experience. The exercises are to be considered as an inï¿½ tegral part of the text and, ideally, should be addressed when they are met, rather than at the end of a block of material. Many of them are quite easy and are intended to give the student practice working with the definitions and digesting the current topic before proceeding.

Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Cup of Gold</i>&nbsp;(1929).<br><br> After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books,&nbsp;<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i>&nbsp;(1932) and&nbsp;<i>To a God Unknown</i>&nbsp;(1933), and worked on short stories later collected in&nbsp;<i>The Long Valley</i>&nbsp;(1938). Popular success and financial security came only with&nbsp;<i>Tortilla Flat</i>&nbsp;(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class:&nbsp;<i>In Dubious Battle</i>&nbsp;(1936),&nbsp;<i>Of Mice and Men</i>&nbsp;(1937), and the book considered by many his finest,&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1939).&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1939.<br><br> Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with&nbsp;<i>The Forgotten Village</i>&nbsp;(1941) and a serious student of marine biology with&nbsp;<i>Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette&nbsp;<i>The Moon is Down</i>&nbsp;(1942).<i>Cannery Row</i>&nbsp;(1945),&nbsp;<i>The Wayward Bus</i>&nbsp;(1948), another experimental drama,&nbsp;<i>Burning Bright</i>(1950), and&nbsp;<i>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1951) preceded publication of the monumental&nbsp;<i>East of Eden</i>&nbsp;(1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history.<br><br> The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include&nbsp;<i>Sweet Thursday</i>&nbsp;(1954),&nbsp;<i>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</i>&nbsp;(1957),&nbsp;<i>Once There Was a War</i>&nbsp;(1958),&nbsp;<i>The Winter of Our Discontent&nbsp;</i>(1961),<i>Travels with Charley in Search of America</i>&nbsp;(1962),&nbsp;<i>America and Americans</i>&nbsp;(1966), and the posthumously published&nbsp;<i>Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters</i>&nbsp;(1969),&nbsp;<i>Viva Zapata!</i>(1975),&nbsp;<i>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</i>&nbsp;(1976), and&nbsp;<i>Working Days: The Journals of The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1989).<br><br> Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with the United States Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Steinbeck died in New York in 1968. Today, more than thirty years after his death, he remains one of America's greatest writers and cultural figures.&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 1<br><br>[1]<br><br> THE SALINAS VALLEY is in Northern California. It is a long narrow swale between two ranges of mountains, and the Salinas River winds and twists up the center until it falls at last into Monterey Bay.<br><br>I remember my childhood names for grasses and secret flowers. I remember where a toad may live and what time the birds awaken in the summer&#x2014;and what trees and seasons smelled like&#x2014;how people looked and walked and smelled even. The memory of odors is very rich.<br><br>I remember that the Gabilan Mountains to the east of the valley were light gay mountains full of sun and loveliness and a kind of invitation, so that you wanted to climb into their warm foothills almost as you want to climb into the lap of a beloved mother. They were beckoning mountains with a brown grass love. The Santa Lucias stood up against the sky to the west and kept the valley from the open sea, and they were dark and brooding&#x2014;unfriendly and dangerous. I always found in myself a dread of west and a love of east. Where I ever got such an idea I cannot say, unless it could be that the morning came over the peaks of the Gabilans and the night drifted back from the ridges of the Santa Lucias. It may be that the birth and death of the day had some part in my feeling about the two ranges of mountains.<br><br>From both sides of the valley little streams slipped out of the hill canyons and fell into the bed of the Salinas River. In the winter of wet years the streams ran full-freshet, and they swelled the river until sometimes it raged and boiled, bank full, and then it was a destroyer. The river tore the edges of the farm lands and washed whole acres down; it toppled barns and houses into itself, to go floating and bobbing away. It trapped cows and pigs and sheep and drowned them in its muddy brown water and carried them to the sea. Then when the late spring came, the river drew in from its edges and the sand banks appeared. And in the summer the river didn&#x2019;t run at all above ground. Some pools would be left in the deep swirl places under a high bank. The tules and grasses grew back, and willows straightened up with the flood debris in their upper branches. The Salinas was only a part-time river. The summer sun drove it underground. It was not a fine river at all, but it was the only one we had and so we boasted about it&#x2014;how dangerous it was in a wet winter and how dry it was in a dry summer. You can boast about anything if it&#x2019;s all you have.

In <i>Tools for Teaching Academic Vocabulary</i>, Janet Allen provides strategies that will help students learn new words, become more conscious of words, and increase competence in knowing when and how to use words.<br><br><i>Tools for Teaching Academic Vocabulary</i> centers on four components of effective vocabulary instruction&#x2014;providing rich and varied language experiences, teaching individual words, teaching word-learning strategies, and fostering word consciousness&#x2014;and provides tools to develop effective instruction for each component. Janet offers advice on teaching vocabulary across the curriculum, exploring how best to teach general academic vocabulary, discipline-specific vocabulary, topic-specific vocabulary, and passage-critical vocabulary.<br><br> Like its popular predecessors, <i>Tools for Content Literacy</i> and <i>More Tools for Content Literacy</i>, this spiral-bound, tabbed flipchart offers instant access to succinct descriptions, practical strategies, and manageable assessments.

In <i>The Inflationary Universe,</i> physicist Alan Guth recounts his and others' struggle to expound a theory that could plug the gaps. The outcome is a theory of "inflation" that postulates that the universe underwent an incomprehensibly large expansion in the first fraction of a microsecond of its existence. With the perspective that only a first-person account could provide, <i>The Inflationary Universe</i> sheds light on a leading theory in humankind's continuing quest to understand the universe we live in.<b>Alan Guth</b> is V.

James P. Delgado provides a comprehensive examination of the Gold Rush from the perspective of the mariners to demonstrate that maritime activity is a pervasive thread in the event&#39;s history.</p><p>A popular concept of the gold rush portrays the overland migration, yet according to the evidence, more people journeyed by sea. The significant factor in this maritime traffic was cargo--supplies for miners and an expanding population. Delgado, maritime historian of the National Park Service, here presents a comprehensive account of shipping during the gold rush era. He reviews briefly maritime trade prior to 1848--furs, hides, whaling--and the settling of San Francisco. He follows shipping around the Horn, steamship service on the Panama and Nicaragua routes and California traffic. Panama steamers carried homebound argonauts and mail until that service was taken over by the U.S. Navy in 1850. Delgado explores the development of the San Francisco waterfront and maritime industries along the coast; he describes shipwrecks and efforts to salvage cargo. This colorful history is a notable addition to the literature of the gold rush.

From the establishment of early ports and the need for seafaring laws to the evolution of towns and regulatory agencies, this provides a different perspective on the Gold Rush's affect on maritime industry. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Twentieth-Century America: A Social and Political History</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This book presents a compelling story of both the familiar and distant events and people of the twentieth century.

Montgomery, was a Canadian author best known for a series of novels beginning with <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>, published in 1908. <i>Anne of Green Gables</i> was an immediate success. The central character, Anne, an orphaned girl, made Montgomery famous in her lifetime and gave her an international following. The first novel was followed by a series of sequels. Montgomery went on to publish twenty novels as well as 500 short stories and poems. Because many of the novels were set on Prince Edward Island, Canada and the Canadian province became literary landmarks. She was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1935.</p><h2>When Markets Collide: Investment Strategies for the Age of Global Economic Change</h2><p><p><b>SELECTED AS A 2008 BEST BUSINESS BOOK OF THE YEAR BY THE ECONOMIST</b> </p><p><b>"ONE OF THE SMARTEST INVESTORS ON THE PLANET."--<i>MONEY</i> MAGAZINE</b> </p><p><b>&#x201c;This book is an essential read for those who wish to understand the modern world of investing.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;Alan Greenspan</b><br></p> <p><b>Winner of the 2008 <i>Financial Times</i> and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award</b> </p><p><i>When Markets Collide</i> is a timely alert to the fundamental changes taking place in today's global economic and financial systems--and a call to action for investors who may fall victim to misinterpreting important signals.

Not that I have anything against great men. In my way, sir, I consider myself one of your kind. But whenever I see our prime minister and his distinguished sidekicks drive to the airport in black cars and get out and do <i>namastes</i> before you in front of a TV camera and tell you about how moral and saintly India is, I have to say that thing in English. </p><p> Now, you <i>are</i> visiting us this week, Your Excellency, aren't you? All India Radio is usually reliable in these matters. </p><p> That was a joke, sir. </p><p> Ha! </p><p> That's why I want to ask you directly if you really are coming to Bangalore. Because if you are, I have something important to tell you. See, the lady on the radio said, "Mr. Jiabao is on a mission: he wants to know the truth about Bangalore." </p><p> My blood froze. If anyone knows the truth about Bangalore, it's <i>me</i>. </p><p> Next, the lady announcer said, "Mr. Jiabao wants to meet some Indian entrepreneurs and hear the story of their success from their own lips." </p><p> She explained a little. Apparently, sir, you Chinese are far ahead of us in every respect, except that you don't have entrepreneurs. And our nation, though it has no drinking water, electricity, sewage system, public transportation, sense of hygiene, discipline, courtesy, or punctuality, <i>does</i> have entrepreneurs. Thousands and thousands of them. Especially in the field of technology. And these entrepreneurs -- <i>we</i> entrepreneurs -- have set up all these outsourcing companies that virtually run America now. </p><p> You hope to learn how to make a few Chinese entrepreneurs, that's why you're visiting. That made me feel good. But then it hit me that in keeping with international protocol, the prime minister and foreign minister of my country will meet you at the airport with garlands, small take-home sandalwood statues of Gandhi, and a booklet full of information about India's past, present, and future. </p><p> That's when I <i>had</i> to say that thing in English, sir. Out loud. </p><p> That was at 11:37 p.m. Five minutes ago. </p><p> I don't just swear and curse. I'm a man of action and change. I decided right there and then to start dictating a letter to you. To begin with, let me tell you of my great admiration for the ancient nation of China. </p><p> I read about your history in a book, <i>Exciting Tales of the Exotic East</i>, that I found on the pavement, back in the days when I was trying to get some enlightenment by going through the Sunday secondhand book market in Old Delhi. This book was mostly about pirates and gold in Hong Kong, but it did have some useful background information too: it said that you Chinese are great lovers of freedom and individual liberty. The British tried to make you their servants, but you never let them do it. I admire that, Mr. Premier. </p><p> I was a servant once, you see. </p><p> Only three nations have never let themselves be ruled by foreigners: China, Afghanistan, and Abyssinia. These are the only three nations I admire. </p><p> Out of respect for the love of liberty shown by the Chinese people, and also in the belief that the future of the world lies with the yellow man and the brown man now that our erstwhile master, the white-skinned man, has wasted himself through buggery, cell phone usage, and drug abuse, I offer to tell you, free of charge, the truth about Bangalore. </p><p> By telling you my life's story. </p><p> See, when you come to Bangalore, and stop at a traffic light, some boy will run up to your car and knock on your window, while holding up a bootlegged copy of an American business book, wrapped carefully in cellophane and with a title like: </p><p> <b>TEN SECRETS OF BUSINESS SUCCESS!</b> </p><p> or </p><p> <b>BECOME AN ENTREPRENEUR IN SEVEN EASY DAYS!</b> </p><p> Don't waste your money on those American books. They're so <i>yesterday</i>. </p><p> I am tomorrow. </p><p> In terms of formal education, I may be somewhat lacking. I never finished school, to put it bluntly. Who cares! I haven't read many books, but I've read all the ones that count. I know by heart the works of the four greatest poets of all time -- Rumi, Iqbal, Mirza Ghalib, and a fourth fellow whose name I forget. I am a self-taught entrepreneur. </p><p> That's the best kind there is, trust me. </p><p> When you have heard the story of how I got to Bangalore and became one of its most successful (though probably least known) businessmen, you will know everything there is to know about how entrepreneurship is born, nurtured, and developed in this, the glorious twenty-first century of man. </p><p> The century, more specifically, of the <i>yellow</i> and the <i>brown</i> man. </p><p> You and me. </p><p> It is a little before midnight now, Mr. Jiabao. A good time for me to talk. </p><p> I stay up the whole night, Your Excellency. And there's no one else in this 150-square-foot office of mine. Just me and a chandelier above me, although the chandelier has a personality of its own. It's a huge thing, full of small diamond-shaped glass pieces, just like the ones they used to show in the films of the 1970s. Though it's cool enough at night in Bangalore, I've put a midget fan -- five cobwebby blades -- right above the chandelier. See, when it turns, the small blades chop up the chandelier's light and fling it across the room. Just like the strobe light at the best discos in Bangalore. </p><p> This is the only 150-square-foot space in Bangalore with its own chandelier! But it's still a hole in the wall, and I sit here the whole night. </p><p> The entrepreneur's curse. He has to watch his business all the time. </p><p> Now I'm going to turn the midget fan on, so that the chandelier's light spins around the room. </p><p> I am relaxed, sir. As I hope you are. </p><p> Let us begin. </p><p> Before we do that, sir, the phrase in English that I learned from my ex-employer the late Mr. Ashok's ex-wife Pinky Madam is: </p><p> <i>What a fucking joke</i>. </p><p> <b> -- -- -- </b> </p><p> Now, I no longer watch Hindi films -- on principle -- but back in the days when I used to, just before the movie got started, either the number 786 would flash against the black screen -- the Muslims think this is a magic number that represents their god -- or else you would see the picture of a woman in a white sari with gold sovereigns dripping down to her feet, which is the goddess Lakshmi, of the Hindus. </p><p> It is an ancient and venerated custom of people in my country to start a story by praying to a Higher Power. </p><p> I guess, Your Excellency, that I too should start off by kissing some god's arse. </p><p> <i>Which</i> god's arse, though? There are so many choices. </p><p> See, the Muslims have one god. </p><p> The Christians have three gods. </p><p> And we Hindus have 36,000,000 gods. </p><p> Making a grand total of 36,000,004 divine arses for me to choose from. </p><p> Now, there are some, and I don't just mean Communists like you, but thinking men of all political parties, who think that not many of these gods actually exist. Some believe that <i>none</i> of them exist. There's just us and an ocean of darkness around us. I'm no philosopher or poet, how would I know the truth? It's true that all these gods seem to do awfully little work -- much like our politicians -- and yet keep winning reelection to their golden thrones in heaven, year after year.

Fascist regimes are assigned to the evil right, Marxist-Leninist regimes to the benign left. But this distinction has left us without a coherent understanding of the revolutionary history of the twentieth century, contends A. James Gregor in this insightful book. He traces the evolution of Marxist theory from the 1920s through the 1990s and argues that the ideology of Marxism-Leninism devolved into fascism. Fascist regimes and Communist regimes - both anti-democratic ideocracies - are far more closely related than has been recognised. Employing wide-ranging primary source materials in Italian, German, Russian, and Chinese, the book opens with an examination of the first standard Marxist interpretation of Mussolini&#39;s fascism in the early 1920s and proceeds through the emergence of fascist phenomena in post-Communist Russia. A clearer understanding of the relation between fascism and communism provides a sharper lens through which to view twentieth-century history as well as the present and future politics of Russia, Communist China, and other non-democratic states, Gregor concludes.</p><p>James Gregor, professor of political science at the University of California at Berkeley and adjunct professor at Marine Corps University, has written extensively on fascism.</p><h2>The Law of Torts: Examples and Explanations</h2><p>Both students and instructors will welcome the new edition of Joseph W.

Coho. A person who own a house with an unrelated person. <br><br> 2. Commercial frustration. An unforeseen and uncontrollable event that excuses a party to a contract from performing his or her duties under that contract.<br><br> 3. Dynasty trust. A trust designed to pass down family wealth for many generations while avoiding transfer taxes (estate tax and generation-skipping tax) to the greatest extent possible.<br><br> 4. Heir hunter. A business that searches for relatives entitled to inherit from the estate or trust of a deceased person. Heir hunters often refuse to provide details unless the heir agrees to pay a fee of one-tenth to one-third of the amount that`s eventually inherited. Probate courts sometimes declare these arrangements invalid too unfair to enforce.<br><br> 5. Owelty. Under common law, an amount that one co-owner must pay to another after a lawsuit to partition real estate, so that each co-owner receives equal value from the property.<br><br> 6. Patent troll. Disparaging term for someone who sues for patent infringement but who does not make or sell any product using the patented technology.<br><br> 7. Puffery. Exaggeration of the good points of a product, a business, real property, and the prospects for future rise in value, profits and growth. Since a certain amount of puffery can be expected of any salesperson, it cannot be the basis of a lawsuit for fraud or breach of contract unless egregious or an outright lie. <br><br> 8. Rhadamanthine. Strict and inflexible in the application of the law; sometimes used to describe a judge.<br><br> 9. Rule of doubt. The rule under which the U.S. Copyright Office allows object code to be deposited in connection with a computer program registration. It means that the code may not qualify for copyright protection. In essence, the Copyright Office is saying, "We will let you deposit object code, but since we can't read or understand it, we won't commit ourselves as to its copyrightability." <br><br> 10. Trust protector. A person or company with the job of keeping an eye on a trustee and making sure the trust's purposes are fulfilled.<b>Gerald N.

The book includes a foreword by the museum director. It lacks references. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>Although often overshadowed by the National Gallery, the Smithsonian American Art Museum (formerly the National Museum of American Art) possesses the largest collection of American artwork in the world. While its quarters in Washington's Old Patent Office Building are being renovated, 500 of its best objects are traveling to dozens of regional venues across the country. These catalogs represent half of the museum's eight thematic exhibitions. Each book is a carbon copy of its sister publications in format, tone, number of works, and level of detail or lack thereof. Each is a handheld version of the show itself and nothing more: there is no index or bibliography and only the slimmest of supplementary texts. After a paragraph of summary embedded in a boilerplate introductory essay, roughly 50 works are shown in large color plates and accompanied by a two-paragraph caption resembling what one could find in gallery wall labels. While sometimes straining to point out the obvious, these brief comments are nevertheless often piquant observations of each piece's aesthetic values. With such an exceptional collection to select from, the shows are curatorial tours de force. Modernism &amp; Abstraction is an outstanding arrangement of 20th-century artwork with many landmark works by giants of the American avant-garde, while Arte Latino presents a great variety of style, media, and subject matter within a collection of mostly contemporary pieces by Latino-American artists. A good introduction to the genre, Contemporary Folk Art is an interesting potpourri of assemblages and paintings both na?ve and savvy. Scenes of American Life focuses almost exclusively on the lives of common citizens and is dominated by Depression-era paintings and murals. These works are nicely illustrated, but with little supportive text they can be recommended only for libraries not already owning the museum's 1995 or 1985 catalogs. Douglas F.

The documents collected in this work focus on the simultaneous struggle for renewal and reform within the Catholic Church. There was much amiss within the Church at the close of the Middle Ages. The Protestant Reformation threw into high relief the urgent need for religious reform. Involving basic questions of doctrine, practice, and authority, this severe trial put in jeopardy the very life of the existing Catholic Church. </p><p>The balanced selection of notable and representative source materials tells their story in a lively and dramatic way.

In <i>Objectivity</i>, Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison chart the emergence of objectivity in the mid-nineteenth-century sciences&#x2015;and show how the concept differs from its alternatives, truth-to-nature and trained judgment. This is a story of lofty epistemic ideals fused with workaday practices in the making of scientific images.</p><p>From the eighteenth through the early twenty-first centuries, the images that reveal the deepest commitments of the empirical sciences&#x2015;from anatomy to crystallography&#x2015;are those featured in scientific atlases, the compendia that teach practitioners what is worth looking at and how to look at it. Galison and Daston use atlas images to uncover a hidden history of scientific objectivity and its rivals. Whether an atlas maker idealizes an image to capture the essentials in the name of truth-to-nature or refuses to erase even the most incidental detail in the name of objectivity or highlights patterns in the name of trained judgment is a decision enforced by an ethos as well as by an epistemology.</p><p>As Daston and Galison argue, atlases shape the subjects as well as the objects of science. To pursue objectivity&#x2015;or truth-to-nature or trained judgment&#x2015;is simultaneously to cultivate a distinctive scientific self wherein knowing and knower converge. Moreover, the very point at which they visibly converge is in the very act of seeing not as a separate individual but as a member of a particular scientific community. Embedded in the atlas image, therefore, are the traces of consequential choices about knowledge, persona, and collective sight. <i>Objectivity</i> is a book addressed to anyone interested in the elusive and crucial notion of objectivity&#x2015;and in what it means to peer into the world scientifically.</p></p><p>Lorraine J. Daston is Director at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin and Visiting Professor in the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago. She is the coauthor (with Katharine Park) of <i>Wonders and the Order of Nature, 1150&#x2013;1750</i> and (with Peter Galison) <i>Objectivity</i> and the editor of <i>Things that Talk: Object Lessons from Art and Science</i>, all three published by Zone Books.<p>Historically brilliant, philosophically profound, and beautifully written, <i>Objectivity</i> will be the focus of discussion for decades to come. At one and the same time a history of scientific objectivity and a history of the scientific self, rarely have rigor and imagination been combined so seamlessly and to such deep effect.

The first, well-received volume of the author's <i>Spheres</i> trilogy, <i>Bubbles</i>, dealt with microspheres: the fact that individuals, from the fetal stage to childhood, are never alone, because they always incorporate the Other into themselves and align themselves with it. With <i>Globes</i>, Sloterdijk opens up a history of the political world using the morphological models of the orb and the globe, and argues that all previous statements about globalization have suffered from shortsightedness. For him, globalization begins with the ancient Greeks, who represented the whole world through the shape of the orb. With the discovery of America and the first circumnavigations of the earth, the orb was replaced by the globe. This second globalization is currently giving way to the third, which we are living through today, as the general virtuality of all conditions leads to a growing spatial crisis.</p><p>Peter Sloterdijk tells here the true story of globalization: from the geometrization of the sky in Plato and Aristotle to the circumnavigation of the last orb&#x2015;the earth&#x2015;by ships, capital, and signals.</p></p><p>Peter Sloterdijk (b. 1947) is one of the best known and widely read German intellectuals writing today. His 1983 publication of <i>Critique of Cynical Reason</i> (published in English in 1988) became the best-selling German book of philosophy since World War II. He became president of the State Academy of Design at the Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe in 2001. He has been cohost of a discussion program, <i>Das Philosophische Quartett</i> (Philosophical Quartet) on German television since 2002.</p><h2>Selected Writings (New Directions Books)</h2><p><p><strong>A bilingual, illustrated edition of <em>The Selected Writings of Apollinaire</em>, the only representative collection in English translation, with a comprehensive critical Introduction by the translator, Roger Shattuck.</strong></p> When Guillaume Apollinaire died in 1918 at the age of thirty-eight, as the result of a war wound, he was already known as one of the most original and important poets of his time. He had led the migration of Bohemian Paris across the city from Montmartre to Montparnasse; he had helped formulate the principles of Cubism, having written one of the first books on the subject, and coined the word "Surrealist"; and he had demonstrated in his own work those innovations we have come to associate with the most vital investigations of the avant-garde. This bilingual, illustrated edition of <em>The Selected Writings of Apollinaire</em>, the only representative collection in English translation, begins with a comprehensive critical Introduction by the translator, Roger Shattuck. The next section is devoted to poetry. Included here are almost half of Apollinaire&#x2019;s two best-known volumes, <em>Alcools</em> and <em>Calligrammes</em>, as well as a selection from five other books, and the long love poem <em>La Chanson du Mal-Aimï¿½</em> in its entirety. The prose section leads off with "L&#x2019;Esprit Nouveau et les Poetes", a seminal discussion of modern poetry that anticipates such movements as Dada and Futurism. This is followed by Apollinaire&#x2019;s almost unobtainable "Introduction to Baudelaire and Oneirocriticism", an early experimental work composed in a style prophetic of Surrealist automatic writing. There are, in addition, two stories, a passage from Anecdotiques, and a section from the novel <em>Le Poete Assassinï¿½</em>.</p><p>When Guillaume Apollinaire died in 1918 at the age of thirty-eight, as the result of a war wound, he was already known as one of the most original and important poets of his time.

He has written nine art books for children, including <i>No One Saw: Ordinary Things Through the Eyes of an Artist; Art Is...; More Than Meets the Eye: Seeing Art with All Five Senses; Unlikely Pairs: Fun with Famous Works of Art; Here's Looking at Me: How Artists See Themselves</i>; and <i>3-D ABC: A Sculptural Alphabet</i>.Grade 3-6&#x2013;In this top-notch introduction to self-portraiture, Raczka delves more deeply into each selection than in his <i>More Than Meets the Eye</i> (Millbrook, 2003). A single opening page prepares the way, whetting readers' appetites by having them consider how they would portray themselves. Full spreads follow, in which one page contains a labeled image and the other presents the related narrative on a faux parchment background. Raczka has chosen carefully; within his 14 examples, he manages to include three women, a range of cultures, and a span of periods and ages (Dï¿½rer drew a version of himself at age 13). The moods vary as do the media, although, unfortunately, the media are not listed anywhere. The reproductions are clear, and the writing offers tidbits about the artists' lives as well as interpretation about the works. Viewers reading and looking closely will learn that Goya affixed candles to his hat so he could work at night, that Chagall painted himself with seven fingers for a reason, and that Rockwell's Triple Self Portrait includes many more than three. Peggy Roalf's fine <i>Looking at Paintings: Self-Portraits</i> (Hyperion, 1993) covers several of the same artists (although most of the portraits differ) and many additional names with a similar organization. A class would benefit from exposure to both; browsers may wish to begin with the shorter length and conversational style of this title.<i>&#x2013;Wendy Lukehart, Washington DC Public Library</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But despite the apparent ubiquity of the term, the concept of sustainability has come to mean a number of specific things. In this accessible guide to the meanings of sustainability, Kent Portney describes the evolution of the idea and examines its application in a variety of contemporary contexts&#x2015;from economic growth and consumption to government policy and urban planning.</p><p>Portney takes as his starting point the 1987 definition by the World Commission on Environment and Development of sustainability as economic development activity that &#x201c;meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.&#x201d; At its heart, Portney explains, sustainability focuses on the use and depletion of natural resources. It is not the same as environmental protection or natural resource conservation; it is more about finding some sort of steady state so that the earth can support both human population and economic growth. </p><p>Portney looks at political opposition to the promotion of sustainability, which usually questions the need for sustainability or calls its costs unacceptable; collective and individual consumption of material goods and resources and to what extent they must be curtailed to achieve sustainability; the role of the private sector, and the co-opting of sustainability by corporations; government policy on sustainability at the international, national, and subnational levels; and how cities could become models for sustainability action. </p></p><p>Kent E.

For example, mercury aflatoxin, Streptococcus pneumonia, Epstein Barre virus, orthophosphotyrosine, benzene. Such a test is not as sensitive as the organ test, described next, but for this reason allows you to select those entities most abundant in the body and therefore of special significance. </p><p>2.You can identify which organs contain a particular entity. For example, the mercury may be in the kidney, the Streptococcus in the joints, and so on. This allows you to embark on a cleanup program for your body in a focused way. The syncrometer lets you monitor your progress. </p><p>3.You can detect entities in products. For example, lead in your household water, thulium in your reverse osmosis water, asbestos in your sugar.</p></p><p>Dr. Clark is an independent research scientist.

It tells of the advent and the rise of the Snopes family in Frenchman's Bend, a small town built on the ruins of a once-stately plantation. Flem Snopes -- wily, energetic, a man of shady origins -- quickly comes to dominate the town and its people with his cunning and guile.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>William Faulkner was born in New Albany, Mississippi, on September 25, 1897.

Commissioned by Pope Julius II to decorate the walls of his private library, Raphael&#39;s fresco &#39;School of Athens&#39; represents the gathering of the philosophers of the ancient world around the central figures of Plato and Aristotle. Presented in this volume is the early criticism of the fresco, by Bellori and Wolfflin, along with new interpretations, published in this volume for the first time, of its iconography in relation to the other frescoes in the Stanza and in the context of the humanism and rhetorical tradition of the papal court; analysis of Raphael&#39;s groundbreaking use of light and color; and an inquiry into the role of Bramante and antique architecture in Raphael&#39;s design.</p><p>This book examines one of the masterpieces of the Italian Renaissance and the artist&#39;s best known work.

Speculation remains rife as to its probable conclusion; evidence suggests that, fascinated as Dickens was by details of the plotting, his basic concern was for character and appropriate setting, in particular the character of the hero-villain, Jasper. The ancient city of Cloisterham, its cathedral a reminder of mortality, human frailty, and the lawful life, is an effective background for what Dickens&#39;s daughter called a tale of &#39;the tragic secrets of the human heart&#39;. Humour is provided by a host of characters ranging from Mr Grewgious, the admirable though eccentric lawyer, and Miss Twinkleton, guardian of the Young Ladies&#39; Seminary, to Durdles, the hard-drinking stonemason, and Deputy, the irreverent lodging-house boy.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.The main issue in the novel is the disappearance of Edwin Drood and the suspicion that he has been murdered. But as intriguing as this central plot are the startling innovations in Dicken&#39;s work and the troubled elements lurking within the novel: a dark opium underworld, the uneasy and violent fantasies of its inhabitants, the disquieting presence of old &#39;Princess Puffer&#39;, of the quiet cathedral town of Cloisterham from which people have to escape in order to save themselves--and, at the centre, the menacing figure of Jasper.</p><h2>Zen and the Brain: Toward an Understanding of Meditation and Consciousness</h2><p><i>Winner of the Scientific and Medical Network Book Prize for 1998</i><br> <br> Aldous Huxley called humankind's basic trend toward spiritual growth the "perennial philosophy." In the view of James Austin, the trend implies a "perennial <i>psychophysiology</i>"&#x2014;because awakening, or enlightenment, occurs only when the human brain undergoes substantial changes. What are the peak experiences of enlightenment? How could these states profoundly enhance, and yet simplify, the workings of the brain? <i>Zen and the Brain</i> presents the latest evidence.<br> <br> In this book Zen Buddhism becomes the opening wedge for an extraordinarily wide-ranging exploration of consciousness. In order to understand which brain mechanisms produce Zen states, one needs some understanding of the anatomy, physiology, and chemistry of the brain. Austin, both a neurologist and a Zen practitioner, interweaves the most recent brain research with the personal narrative of his Zen experiences. The science is both inclusive and rigorous; the Zen sections are clear and evocative. Along the way, Austin examines such topics as similar states in other disciplines and religions, sleep and dreams, mental illness, consciousness-altering drugs, and the social consequences of the advanced stage of ongoing enlightenment.</p><p>Take a trip through the topography of the brain, and you're likely to get lost somewhere around the medulla oblongata. Zen can lose you before you've even pretzeled your legs into the lotus position. But a unique neurologist-Zen Buddhist has written a tome that is a map to all the mysteries of meditation and mind. Take breathing out, for example. We spend just over half of our breathing time exhaling. For meditating monks, it's a full three-quarters. EEGs show us that the act of exhaling helps physically quiet the brain. Many other causal connections can be found between Zen practices and the physiology of the brain, and James H. Austin lays them out one by one, drawing from his own Zen experiences and the latest in neurological research. So if you've ever wondered what the corpus callosum has to do with consciousness or how the limbic system contributes to enlightenment, Austin will get your brain racing and put your mind at ease. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>James H. Austin, clinical neurologist, researcher, and Zen practitioner, is Professor Emeritus of Neurology at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and Clinical Professor of Neurology at the University of Missouri (Columbia) School of Medicine. He is the author of <i>Zen and the Brain, Chase, Chance, and Creativity,</i> and <i>Zen-Brain Reflections,</i> all published by the MIT Press.</p><h2>The Nude: Creative Photography Workshop</h2><p>Advice on every aspect of nude photography will enable you to reveal the sensual curves, contours, and symmetry of the female form, whether your goal is purely artistic or frankly erotic.

For the second edition, the text has been thoroughly revised in order to bring it right up to date, and to make it as useful as possible for teachers and students from a range of behavioral and social science disciplines. Changes for the new edition include: Examples and references have been updated, and new examples have been drawn in from the fields of applied psychology, applied social science, health studies, social work and education. Greater emphasis has been placed on flexible designs using largely qualitative methods, including additional coverage of ethnographic and grounded theory approaches. Critical discussion is included of the place of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and statistical significance testing in fixed, quantitative design research The quantitative analysis section is now based around the current version of SPSS, while the section on qualitative analysis is now based around the NUD*IST software. Material has been added on combining quantitative and qualitative approaches. The author has situated the material more clearly within theoretical conceptualizations of the nature of social science research, pointing to the advantages of a critical realist approach. The text now incorporates more on tests and test theory. Improvements to the pedagogical material include the addition of a glossary and detailed cross-referencing across chapters. For sample chapters please visit www.blackwellpublishing.com/robsonThough few students of the behavioural and social sciences go on to be laboratory-based experimentalists, traditional degree and other courses, and the texts that they use, tend to concentrate very largely on the design and analysis of laboratory experiments. Many graduates do however go on to jobs where they are called upon to carry out some form of enquiry task - often in complex, messy, poorly controlled situations.<br><p>This text is the first to give advice and support in the carrying out of such real world research. The emphasis is on achieving rigour and trustworthiness in the enquiry through systematic procedures appropriate to the task. Particular features include an advocacy of multi-method case study as a serious strategy alongside field experimentation and the survey, and an even-handed coverage of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Many real world studies are, in effect, evaluations and their distinctive features are stressed. A final section covers issues in 'making an impact' including different approaches to reporting, the place of enquiry in promoting change, and the relative roles of practitioners and researchers.</p></p><h2>The Great Mistake: How We Wrecked Public Universities and How We Can Fix Them (Critical University Studies)</h2><p><p>Winner of the CHOICE Outstanding Academic Title of the Choice ACRL</p><p>Higher education in America, still thought to be the world leader, is in crisis. University students are falling behind their international peers in attainment, while suffering from unprecedented student debt. For over a decade, the realm of American higher education has been wracked with self-doubt and mutual recrimination, with no clear solutions on the horizon. How did this happen? In this stunning new book, Christopher Newfield offers readers an in-depth analysis of the "great mistake" that led to the cycle of decline and dissolution, a mistake that impacts every public college and university in America. What might occur, he asserts, is no less than locked-in economic inequality and the fall of the middle class. </p><p>In<i> The Great Mistake</i>, Newfield asks how we can fix higher education, given the damage done by private-sector models. The current accepted wisdom&#x2015;that to succeed, universities should be more like businesses&#x2015;is dead wrong. Newfield combines firsthand experience with expert analysis to show that private funding and private-sector methods cannot replace public funding or improve efficiency, arguing that business-minded practices have increased costs and gravely damaged the university&#x2019;s value to society. </p><p>It is imperative that universities move beyond the destructive policies that have led them to destabilize their finances, raise tuition, overbuild facilities, create a national student debt crisis, and lower educational quality. Laying out an interconnected cycle of mistakes, from subsidizing the private sector to "the poor get poorer" funding policies, Newfield clearly demonstrates how decisions made in government, in the corporate world, and at colleges themselves contribute to the dismantling of once-great public higher education. A powerful, hopeful critique of the unnecessary death spiral of higher education, <i>The Great Mistake</i> is essential reading for those who wonder why students have been paying more to get less and for everyone who cares about the role the higher education system plays in improving the lives of average Americans.</p></p><p><p>A remarkable indictment of how misguided business policies have undermined the American higher education system.</p><p>Higher education in America, still thought to be the world leader, is in crisis.

And because everyone is busy, many families come to rely on store-bought &#x201c;healthy&#x201d; products to make life simpler, but many of these are loaded with sugar and hidden toxins. When faced with her own family health crisis, mother and health coach Leah Webb realized that in order to consistently provide high quality food for her family, nearly 100 percent of their meals would need to be homemade. But when she looked for a resource to guide her, most cookbooks that offered recipes &#x201c;free&#x201d; of allergenic foods were also high in processed starches, flours, and sugar. Webb, like so many parents, was looking for a cookbook that offered deeply nutritious, kid-friendly, whole foods recipes that were also <em>easy</em>, but there wasn&#x2019;t one&#x2015;so she wrote it herself.</p> <p><em>The Grain-Free, Sugar-Free, Dairy-Free Family Cookbook</em> offers a new system to preparing food and approaching the kitchen that gets kids involved in cooking, which encourages excitement around food (a major challenge with restrictive diets). The recipes are rich in healthy fats, nutrient-dense vegetables, ferments, and grass-fed meats, and include snacks, school lunches, and delicious sweet treats that rival the flavors of sugar-dense desserts. By following Leah&#x2019;s meal plans, parents will be sure to please everyone in the family and make cooking on a restrictive diet enjoyable and doable over a long period of time. Families that know they would like to rid themselves of grain, sugar, and dairy, but are intimidated by starting, will find Webb&#x2019;s advice and troubleshooting invaluable.</p> <p>The cookbook outlines family-tested methods that make for effective and efficient preparation, including everyday basic recipes that will become part of a cook&#x2019;s intuitive process over time. The best part is that although Leah prepares nearly every single one of her family&#x2019;s breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and snacks using whole food ingredients, she only spends four to six hours on food preparation per week! Through stocking her freezer, prepping the kitchen, shopping and cooking in bulk, and consistently planning meals, this diet plan is not only possible; it is manageable and fulfilling. Prepare for this cookbook to radically change your life.</p></p><p><p>Leah M.

The book provides a rigorous overview of the subject, while its flexible presentation makes it suitable for use with different levels of undergraduate and graduate students. Each chapter presents mathematical models of financial problems at three different degrees of sophistication: single-period, multi-period, and continuous-time. The single-period and multi-period models require only basic calculus and an introductory probability/statistics course, while an advanced undergraduate course in probability is helpful in understanding the continuous-time models. In this way, the material is given complete coverage at different levels; the less advanced student can stop before the more sophisticated mathematics and still be able to grasp the general principles of financial economics.</p><p>The book is divided into three parts. The first part provides an introduction to basic securities and financial market organization, the concept of interest rates, the main mathematical models, and quantitative ways to measure risks and rewards. The second part treats option pricing and hedging; here and throughout the book, the authors emphasize the Martingale or probabilistic approach. Finally, the third part examines equilibrium models&#x2015;a subject often neglected by other texts in financial mathematics, but included here because of the qualitative insight it offers into the behavior of market participants and pricing.</p></p><p>"This is a sophisticated yet highly readable introduction to the most important ideas of modern financial economics by two leading experts in mathematical finance." --Andrew W. Lo, Harris &amp; Harris Group Professor, Sloan School, MIT <p>"This book provides a very clear and readable approach to the structure, background, and theory of modern financial markets. It can easily be used as a text for a graduate course in quantitative finance and as a reference by practitioners. Unlike more mathematical treatments, however, most of its content should also be accessible to good MBA students." --Robert J. Elliott, RBC Financial Group Professor of Finance, University of Calgary </p><p>"This is a very well done text that lives up to its billing as an introduction to both the economics and the mathematics of finance. The authors are to be commended for having avoided both the Scylla of the typical mathematical exposition in which economic examples are treated as asides that merely illustrate some mathematical technique, and the Charybdis of the introductory text that timidly skirts the substantive mathematical issues. The reader who sets down at the table to master this text will come away from the meal fully satisfied." --Stephen A. Ross, Franco Modigliani Professor of Finance and Economics, MIT </p><p>"This book is the first of its kind -- an accessible but rigorous treatment of classic dynamic asset-pricing models, appropriate for master's-level or introductory doctoral courses, and suitable for students from various fields, including economics, finance, or applied mathematics.

He was the clutch second baseman for the dominant New York Yankees of the 1950s. He then spent sixteen seasons managing in the big leagues, and is considered by anyone who knows baseball to have been a true baseball genius, a field manager without peer. Yet he&#x2019;s remembered more for his habit of kicking dirt on umpires, for being hired and fired by George Steinbrenner five times, and for his rabble rousing and public brawls. He was combative, fiery, intimidating, and controversial, yet beloved by the everyday fan. He was hard on his players and even harder on himself. He knew how to turn around a losing team like no one else&#x2014;and how to entertain us every step of the way.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now, with his definitive biography <i>Billy Martin</i>, Pennington finally erases the caricature of Martin. Drawing on exhaustive interviews with friends, family, teammates, and countless adversaries, Pennington paints an indelible portrait of a man who never backed down for the game he loved. From his shantytown upbringing in a broken home; to his days playing for the Yankees when he almost always helped his team find a way to win; through sixteen years of managing, including his tenure in New York in the crosshairs of Steinbrenner and Reggie Jackson, Billy Martin made sure no one ever ignored him.

Using Western and non-Western examples, the authors take a three-pronged approach to understanding dress across cultures, uncovering its relationship to human beings as biological, aesthetic, and social animals. Readings collected from classic books and academic journals enable students to appreciate the complexity of dress from a multidisciplinary perspective that includes anthropology, sociology, economics, fine arts, and the natural sciences.</p></p><p><p>Joanne B.

Furthermore, Cooper turned novel writing from a polite diversion into a paying career. He influenced Herman Melville, Richard Henry Dana, Jr., Francis Parkman, and even Mark Twain&#x2014;who felt the need to flagellate Cooper for his &#x201c;literary offenses.&#x201d; His novels mark the starting point for any history of our environmental conscience. Far from complicit in the cleansings of Native Americans that characterized the era, Cooper&#x2019;s fictions traced native losses to their economic sources. Perhaps no other American writer stands in greater need of a major reevaluation than Cooper. This is the first treatment of Cooper&#x2019;s life to be based on full access to his family papers. Cooper&#x2019;s life, as Franklin relates it, is the story of how, in literature and countless other endeavors, Americans in his period sought to solidify their political and cultural economic independence from Britain and, as the Revolutionary generation died, stipulate what the maturing republic was to become. The first of two volumes, <i>James Fenimore Cooper: The Early Years</i> covers Cooper&#x2019;s life from his boyhood up to 1826, when, at the age of thirty-six, he left with his wife and five children for Europe.</p><p>American author James Fenimore Cooper (1789&#x2013;1851) has been credited with inventing and popularizing a wide variety of genre fiction, including the Western, the spy novel, the high seas adventure tale, and the Revolutionary War romance.

But few people understand just how or why they happen and, more important, the immeasurable consequences that often haunt the lucky few who are acquitted, years after they are proven innocent.</p><p>Now, in this groundbreaking anthology, fourteen exonerated inmates narrate their stories to a roster of high-profile mystery and thriller writers&#x2015;including Lee Child, Sara Paretsky, Laurie R. King, Jan Burke and S. J. Rozan&#x2015;while another exoneree&#x2019;s case is explored in a previously unpublished essay by legendary playwright Arthur Miller. An astonishing and unique collaboration, these testimonies bear witness to the incredible stories of innocent men and women who were convicted of serious crimes and cast into the maw of a vast and deeply flawed American criminal justice system before eventually, and miraculously, being exonerated.</p><p>Introduced by best-selling authors Scott Turow and Barry Scheck, these master storytellers capture the tragedy of wrongful convictions as never before and challenge readers to confront the limitations and harsh realities of the American criminal justice system. Lee Child tells of Kirk Bloodsworth, who obsessively read about the burgeoning field of DNA testing, cautiously hoping that it held the key to his acquittal&#x2015;until he eventually became the first person to be exonerated from death row based on DNA evidence. Judge John Sheldon and author Gayle Lynds team up to share Audrey Edmunds&#x2019;s experience raising her children long distance from her prison cell. And exoneree Gloria Killian recounts to S. J. Rozan her journey from that fateful "knock on the door" and the initial shock of accusation to the scars she carries today.</p><p>Together, the powerful stories collected within the <em>Anatomy of Innocence</em> detail every aspect of the experience of wrongful conviction, as well as the remarkable depths of endurance sustained by each exoneree who never lost hope.</p> 24 photographs</p><p><p><strong>Laura Caldwell</strong> is the award-winning founder/director of Life After Innocence at Loyola University Chicago School of Law and the author of fourteen novels, including the Izzy McNeil series, as well as <em>Long Way Home</em>.

Klinger</strong> is the editor of numerous books, including the best-selling <em>The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes</em>, <em>The New Annotated Dracula</em>, and <em>The New Annotated H. P. Lovecraft</em>. He lives in Malibu, California.</p>A collection of first-person accounts from individuals who were wrongfully arrested and convicted. Told to mystery and true crime writers such as Lee Child, Sara Paretsky, and Jan Burke, these stories highlight the defects in the police, investigative, and legal system that lead to the prosecution and incarceration of innocent people. Themes such as false confessions, mishandled evidence, and, in highly publicized cases, the desire to quickly finger a suspect rather than find the actual criminal run through the work. Each chapter describes a case (for instance, in 1973, Peter Reilly was arrested for allegedly killing his mother), explains how the individual was exonerated, provides background on the author, and features an editors' note with statistics on false convictions. The brutal reality of police torture and prison life is addressed matter-of-factly. Information on the Innocence Project and member groups by state is appended. Black-and-white photographs of the people profiled are included, along with an update on their lives since exoneration.

In the first biography of Kennedy, Sherie M. Randolph traces the life and political influence of this strikingly bold and controversial radical activist. Rather than simply reacting to the predominantly white feminist movement, Kennedy brought the lessons of Black Power to white feminism and built bridges in the struggles against racism and sexism. Randolph narrates Kennedy's progressive upbringing, her pathbreaking graduation from Columbia Law School, and her long career as a media-savvy activist, showing how Kennedy rose to founding roles in organizations such as the National Black Feminist Organization and the National Organization for Women, allying herself with both white and black activists such as Adam Clayton Powell, H. Rap Brown, Betty Friedan, and Shirley Chisholm.<br><br>Making use of an extensive and previously uncollected archive, Randolph demonstrates profound connections within the histories of the new left, civil rights, Black Power, and feminism, showing that black feminism was pivotal in shaping postwar U.S. liberation movements.<br><br></p><p>Sherie M.

Drawing from Darwin's original notebooks and logs from the <i>Beagle</i>, the latest findings by Darwin scholars and modern science, and their own intimate knowledge of the archipelago, Grant and Estes offer rare insights into Darwin's thinking about evolution in the context of the actual locales that inspired him. They introduce Darwin as a young naturalist in England and onboard the <i>Beagle</i> and then put you in his shoes as he explores remote places in the islands. They identify the unique animals and plants he observed and collected, and describe dramatic changes to the islands since Darwin's time. They also explore the importance of Darwin's observations and collections to the development of his thinking after the voyage.</p><p> Ideal for visitors to Galï¿½pagos and a delight for armchair travelers, <i>Darwin in Galï¿½pagos</i> is generously illustrated with color and black-and-white photographs and line drawings, as well as detailed maps of Darwin's island itinerary and informative box features on the archipelago's natural history.</p></p><p><p>"Grant and Estes, the world's authorities on Darwin in Galï¿½pagos, put readers in young Darwin's mind and meticulously trace his every footstep. They have the most intimate knowledge about this archipelago and a heartfelt friendship with its most famous visitor. Darwin comes alive in this carefully researched book. A book every Galï¿½pagos traveler should read, as should anyone who wants to understand how Darwin became the first evolutionary biologist."<b>--Martin Wikelski, Max Planck Institute for Ornithology and Konstanz University</b></p><p>"This book is a tale of two journeys: Darwin's in the islands, and the authors' as they retraced his steps. Darwin's, of course, was one of the most important series of footsteps in the history of human exploration. And the journey that Thalia Grant and Greg Estes have made is impressive because they have done so much legwork in the islands and the libraries, and have spent so much of their lives working in the archipelago. Outdoors and indoors, it seems to have been a labor of love."<b>--Jonathan Weiner, author of <i>The Beak of the Finch</i></b></p><p>"This volume provides a timely and interesting account of a key moment in Charles Darwin's life--and, it might be said, in the history of evolutionary biology.

This book provides the best description yet of Darwin's trip through the islands. The authors have a remarkable familiarity with the places Darwin visited, and ably share that knowledge."<b>--Edward J. Larson, author of <i>Evolution: The Remarkable History of a Scientific Theory</i></b></p><p>"Grant and Estes provide a vivid and accurate account of where Charles Darwin went on his 1835 visit to the Galï¿½pagos Islands.

Many helpful books on preaching are available. The vast majority are concerned with "how-to," but relatively few focus primarily on the character and theology of preaching according to Scripture. Two key, interrelated questions need to be addressed. First, is there such a thing as "preaching" that is mandated in the post-apostolic context&#x2015;and, if there is, how is it defined and characterized? Second, how does post-apostolic "preaching" relate to the preaching of the Old Testament prophets and of Jesus and his apostles? In this New Studies in Biblical Theology volume Jonathan Griffiths seeks answers to these questions in the New Testament. In Part One he gives an overview of the theology of the Word of God, surveys Greek terms related to preaching, and looks at teaching concerning the scope and character of other word ministries in the life of the church. In Part Two his exegetical studies concentrate on teaching that relates especially to the post-apostolic context. In Part Three he summarizes the exegetical findings, sets them within the context of biblical theology, and proposes a number of broader theological implications. Griffiths's accessible, scholarly investigation will be of value to scholars, pastors, preachers, and Bible teachers. Addressing key issues in biblical theology, the works comprising New Studies in Biblical Theology are creative attempts to help Christians better understand their Bibles. The NSBT series is edited by D. A. Carson, aiming to simultaneously instruct and to edify, to interact with current scholarship, and to point the way ahead.</p><p>Jonathan Griffiths is lead pastor of the Metropolitan Bible Church, Ottawa, Canada. Previously he served on the staff of the Proclamation Trust in London, England, where he taught on the Cornhill Training Course. He is editor of <em>The Perfect Saviour: Key Themes in Hebrews</em>."This volume addresses the need for a biblical theology of preaching by focusing on some foundational matters before closely studying a handful of passages in Paul and in Hebrews. Considering how much preaching is done week by week around the world, it is good to have a study that requires us to reflect on what we are doing." (D. A. Carson)<br><br>"<em>Preaching in the New Testament</em> presents a compelling biblical case for what preaching is and does. The book will not necessarily help readers become <em>better</em> preachers, but it will make them <em>more aware</em> as preachers&#x2015;which, in the end, may make them more effective." (Peter Krol, Bible Study Magazine, November/December 2017)<br><br>"As a pastor myself, I found this book extremely encouraging, and came away not only with a clearer grasp of what God intends to accomplish through my preaching, but with a renewed goal of doing what I can to see that my preaching fulfills those divine purposes." (Gary L. Shultz Jr., The Journal of the Evangelical Homiletics Society, March 2018)<br><br>"What a great encouragement for maintaining the centrality of preaching in our worship! Tasting heaven as God speaks to us through his word; what a great thought! <em>Preaching in the New Testament: An Exegetical and Biblical-Theological Study</em> by Jonathan I. Griffiths is a great scholarly resource and encouragement to pastors in their regular work of exegesis and preaching ministry. Griffiths&#x2019; wok comes with the highest recommendations." (Jacques Roets, Mid-America Journal of Theology)<br><br>"Every volume in this series has been significant and worthy, and this volume follows in that same line. Preachers have found tremendous encouragement, and challenging observations, from Griffiths' unfolding of preaching throughout the New Testament. Preachers will also be encouraged by understanding the gravity and importance of preaching as Griffiths displays the preaching ministry of the Church as found in the New Testament." (R. Albert Mohler, Preaching Magazine, Spring 2018)<br><br>"I recommend this book. It does what it sets out to do. It convincingly shows that preaching is not simply something we do (and to which we listen) because it works or because it has been done for many centuries, but instead because we are commanded to <i>preach the word</i> (2 Tim 4:2, the motto of my alma mater) and to 'desire the pure milk of the word' (1 Pet 2:3)."

Wilkin, Journal of the Grace Evangelical Society, Spring 2017)</p><h2>Eugene Delacroix: Selected Letters, 1813-1863</h2><p>This volume contains the most representative and informative selection available of the letters of Eugene Delacroix, perhaps the most brilliant visual artist of the French Romantic movement. As edited by Jean Stewart, they are divided into four sections: the first letters were written in his teens and early twenties, and show the essential loneliness that would dominate his life; the second, stretching to the age of 35, detail the travels that indelibly marked him; the third group dates from his return to France in 1833, telling of his grand commissions and of his relationships with George Sand and Mme. de Forget; and last are the letters from his final years, a time of official acceptance and relations with such notable figures as Stendhal and Merimee. Intelligently edited and fluently translated, these Selected Letters bring to life, in his own words, one of the greatest artistic geniuses of the 19th century.</p><p></p><h2>The Bell: Vintage Classics Murdoch Series</h2><p>VINTAGE CLASSICS MURDOCH: Funny, subversive, fearless and fiercely intelligent, Iris Murdoch was one of the great writers of the twentieth century.

If you are one of the approximately 2 million people who have watched it, then The Real Truth About Sugar is for you. If you haven&#x2019;t yet seen the video, this book is also for you. Dr. Lustig&#x2019;s case against sugar is more than compelling&#x2014;it&#x2019;s convincing.

In this brief and affordable text, author and series editor Trevor R. Getz demonstrates how Africans pursued lives, constructed social settings, forged trading links, and imagined worlds that were sophisticated, flexible, and well adapted to the increasingly global and fast-paced interactions of this period. Getz's interpretation of a "cosmopolitan Africa" is based on careful reading of Africans' oral histories and traditions, written documents, and images of or from the eighteenth century.

It enables the reader to place specific texts in moral philosophy in a historical perspective by showing the debt moral philosophers owe to their predecessors and the historical development of changes in the moral concepts.</p><p>The author writes...&#39;This history of moral philosophy which runs from the Greeks to contemporary Anglo-Saxon discussion is necessarily compressed and selective, but is intended to enable the general reader and the student to place particular texts in moral philosophy in an historical perspective. The function of this perspective is to clarify three kinds of historical and philosophical connection whose importance is often underrated. The first is a matter of the debts which moral philosophers owe to their predecessors; the second concerns the question of the nature of the moral concepts which furnish any moral philosopher with the objects of his enquiry upon moral concepts themselves and the extent to which the philosophical analysis of a concept may play a part in transforming or even discrediting it. A consequence of these preoccupations is that the book contains a higher proportion of purely philosophical enquiry than might be expected in an historical work.&#39;<b>Alasdair MacIntyre</b> is Rev.

It not only represents an important intellectual step in discussions of art&#x2015;in its rigor and in its having refreshingly set itself the task of creating a set of distinctions for determining what counts as art that could be valid for those creating as well as those receiving art works&#x2015;but it also represents an important advance in systems theory. Returning to the eighteenth-century notion of aesthetics as pertaining to the "knowledge of the senses," Luhmann begins with the idea that all art, including literature, is rooted in perception. He insists on the radical incommensurability between psychic systems (perception) and social systems (communication). Art is a special kind of communication that uses perceptions instead of language. It operates at the boundary between the social system and consciousness in ways that profoundly irritate communication while remaining strictly internal to the social. In seven densely argued chapters, Luhmann develops this basic premise in great historical and empirical detail. Framed by the general problem of art's status as a social system, each chapter elaborates, in both its synchronic and diachronic dimensions, a particular aspect of this problem. The consideration of art within the context of a theory of second-order observation leads to a reconceptualization of aesthetic form. The remaining chapters explore the question of the system's code, its function, and its evolution, concluding with an analysis of "self-description." <i>Art as a Social System</i> draws on a vast body of scholarship, combining the results of three decades of research in the social sciences, phenomenology, evolutionary biology, cybernetics, and information theory with an intimate knowledge of art history, literature, aesthetics, and contemporary literary theory. The book also engages virtually every major theorist of art and aesthetics from Baumgarten to Derrida.</p><p>&#x201c;Art as a Social System deserves to be read as a brilliant synthesis of every major philosophy of art, from Baumgarten to Kristeva, and as an ambitious attempt to understand art history in its entirety. . . . It seems inevitable that North American academics in the humanities will soon confront this challenging work.&#x201d;&#x2014;Literary Research / Recherche Litteraire<br>&#x201c;Thus, what is most interesting about Luhmann&#x2019;s view of art is also what is most interesting about his general theory: its sophisticated and elaborate explorations in the evolutionary development of the media of communication, which are perhaps unparalleled in contemporary theory.&#x201d;&#x2014;American Journal of SociologyNiklas Luhmann was Professor of Sociology at the University of Bielefeld.

In this trenchant illustrated essay, David Joselit describes how art and architecture are being transformed in the age of Google. Under the dual pressures of digital technology, which allows images to be reformatted and disseminated effortlessly, and the exponential acceleration of cultural exchange enabled by globalization, artists and architects are emphasizing networks as never before. Some of the most interesting contemporary work in both fields is now based on visualizing patterns of dissemination after objects and structures are produced, and after they enter into, and even establish, diverse networks. Behaving like human search engines, artists and architects sort, capture, and reformat existing content. Works of art crystallize out of populations of images, and buildings emerge out of the dynamics of the circulation patterns they will house.</p><br><p> Examining the work of architectural firms such as OMA, Reiser + Umemoto, and Foreign Office, as well as the art of Matthew Barney, Ai Weiwei, Sherrie Levine, and many others, <i>After Art</i> provides a compelling and original theory of art and architecture in the age of global networks.</p></p><p><p>"Standing at the intersection of media studies, architectural criticism, and art history, David Joselit's <i>After Art</i> confronts the question of contemporary art in an age of proliferating networks. Joselit tracks the literal and epistemic 'states of form' of recent visual culture and offers a powerful new model for thinking about art's circulation and currency."<b>--Pamela M. Lee, Stanford University</b></p><p>"David Joselit's concisely argued <i>After Art</i> might well have been entitled <i>After Aura</i> as he elegantly replies to Walter Benjamin's sense of art's loss of power with the introduction of technological reproduction. Instead, Joselit makes a persuasive case for the reinvigoration of the power of the image in contemporary artistic and architectural production as a result of the distributive capacity of communication networks."<b>--Anthony Vidler, The Cooper Union</b></p><p>"Pertinent and intelligent, <i>After Art</i> will be of great interest to art historians and readers of contemporary art and media theory."<b>--Sylvia Lavin, author of <i>Kissing Architecture</i></b></p><b>David Joselit</b> is the Carnegie Professor of the History of Art at Yale University.

First published in 1978, this text examines all topics typically covered in a three-or four-hour course in evidence. Emphasis is on the Federal Rules of Evidence, now adopted in most states. Should the reader desire additional material, ample footnotes provide easy access to leading cases, articles, and standard reference works. The Fifth Edition contains an in-depth treatment of the important amendments to the Federal Rules of Evidence, including the most recent addition of Rule 502.</p><p></p><h2>The Penguin Atlas of Ancient History</h2><p>Traces the migrations and evolution of the races as well as the development of civilizations from prehistoric times to the fourth century A.D.</p><p></p><h2>Richard Strauss (Master Musicians Series)</h2><p>"I cannot bear the tragedy of the present time," wrote Richard Strauss in 1924. "I want to create joy. I need it." In a career that extended from the age of Wagner and Brahms to the middle of the twentieth century, Strauss wrote music that kept alive the German Romantic ideals of melody and emotional expressiveness. Among his fifteen operas are the beloved Der Rosenkavalier with its bittersweet evocation of bygone days in imperial Vienna, the ingenious Ariadne auf Naxos, and other works that hold the stage to this day. His brilliant tone poems for orchestra include such staples of the repertory as Death and Transfiguration, Don Juan, Ein Heldenleben, Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks, and Also sprach Zarathustra - source of the famous "sunrise" music used in the film 2001. A distinguished composer of songs, chamber music, and ballets as well, Strauss was also one of the outstanding conductors of his time, directing opera companies in Weimar, Munich, Berlin, and Vienna.<br>In his young manhood, Strauss was regarded by many as a leader of the dissonant avant-garde; his early operas Salome and Elektra feature a harmonic vocabulary that ventures to the brink of the atonal, as well as subject matter considered scandalous at the time. But by the 1930s, Strauss's refusal to follow in the footsteps of Schoenberg and the modernists had led to his being written off as a reactionary. Michael Kennedy challenges this verdict with a comprehensive appreciation of Strauss's music and an evenhanded assessment of his life, including his tempestuous marriage to Pauline de Ahna and his controversial relationship with the Nazi regime. Contradicting the received opinion that Strauss's genius declined after Der Rosenkavalier, this authoritative study makes the case for Strauss as a key figure in the history of the last hundred years of music, widely misrepresented and misunderstood.</p><p>There are few composers whose critical stock has roller-coastered as dramatically as that of Richard Strauss, both during his lifetime and in the five decades since his death in 1949. Once considered a dangerous firebrand of the avant-garde--his early masterpiece <i>Salome</i> was given the equivalent of an X rating--Strauss remained an exceedingly prolific composer throughout his long career, yet lived to be "written off as an extinct volcano." The painful story of his involvement with the Third Reich further cast a pall over his final years. But in the past two decades, a gradual reassessment has been underway--along with a recuperation of his neglected later works--and the field is ripe for a critically insightful overview of Strauss's achievement.<p> Such is the goal of Michael Kennedy, a longtime advocate of Strauss, in his new biography, <i>Richard Strauss: Man, Musician, Enigma</i>. Kennedy, the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i>'s music critic and author of several other musical biographies--including an earlier study of the composer as well as illuminating articles and CD booklets on his music--here undertakes to penetrate the contradictions and see the man whole. Through his impressive access to diaries, letters, and living relatives, he posits an underlying consistency of attitude that made "art the reality in [Strauss's] life." The central enigma about the composer that fascinates Kennedy is the "disparity between man and musician," the paradox that this fundamentally aloof and reserved person, dedicated to bourgeois stability, could produce music of such overpowering passion. </p><p> While steering clear of Freudian reductionism, Kennedy reveals the crucial significance of Strauss's mother's nervous instability--she was eventually committed to various sanatoriums--and the centrality of the work ethic inherited from his father. The result was to make music "Strauss's means of escape ... and in much of his music he wore a mask." Yet for all his aloofness, Strauss "let [the mask] slip"--another aspect of the enigma surrounding him--in such compositions as <i>Don Quixote</i> ("the most profound" of his orchestral works) or the pervasively autobiographical <i>Sinfonia Domestica</i>, <i>Intermezzo</i>, and <i>Capriccio</i>, which Kennedy counts as Strauss's greatest achievement for the lyrical stage.</p><p> Kennedy is particularly persuasive in his high estimation of the post-<i>Rosenkavalier</i> output and the undiminished quest for artistic innovation that they continued to exemplify--above all in Strauss's development of a fluently conversational style in his operas. Although commentary on individual works involves generally concise summations, many observations sparkle with insight, and Kennedy continually sheds light on neglected gems among Strauss's output. The rapport with Hofmannsthal and his other librettists is admirably clarified, and the remarkably well-read Strauss emerges as a more imposingly intellectual figure, steeped in literature and philosophy, than he is usually depicted. We learn of his obsession with the card game skat and of his disdainful attitude toward the new medium of film. Kennedy similarly demystifies much of the received opinion that has developed around the composer, particularly in his level-headed portrait of his wife, Pauline. The fundamental happiness of their lifelong relationship emerges as a context indispensable to Strauss's creative focus.</p><p> Kennedy devotes a significant portion of the book to the composer's position as president of the Reich Music Chamber and subsequent fall from grace both with the Nazis and in world opinion. Here the author aims to offer perspective by carefully detailing the facts and documentary evidence from the time. In his view, Strauss becomes a "tragic figure, symbolising the struggle to preserve beauty and style in Western European culture" against emerging barbarism. Yet, as throughout the book, Kennedy's abiding sympathy with Strauss at times veers close to a kind of special pleading that invites skepticism. For all that, his style is admirably lucid, and his biography largely succeeds in pointing to a greatness that "has not yet been fully understood and discovered." <i>--Thomas May</i></p>This first detailed biography of Strauss for many years re-assesses the man and his music half a century after his death, drawing on much hitherto ignored material. Kennedy considers fully the period during the Third Reich when Strauss was first feted and then cold-shouldered by the authorities, as well as describing his long, happy but tempestuous marriage. A picture emerges of a level-headed, practical and extremely versatile musician--a great conductor as well as a great composer.</p><h2>Spanish Cinema: A Student&#39;s Guide (Hodder Arnold Publication)</h2><p><p>How did the Franco dictatorship and subsequent transition to democracy impact upon Spanish film-making? What is meant by <i>nuevo cine espanol</i> or <i>espanolada</i>? How do you say "close-up" or "tracking shot" in Spanish? What sort of critical methods and tools can we apply to study Spanish cinema and what resources are available to us? This book answers these and many more questions, providing crucial information and examples of analysis normally found in separate volumes. This book will be an indispensable resource for students and teachers of Spanish cinema. <br>Topics include:</p><p>-A history of Spanish cinema from 1896 to 2003<br>-An overview of Film Studies Basics applied to Spanish films. <br>-A review of key critical concepts such as auteurism, genre and stars. <br>-A critical review of Spanish film theory. <br>-Case studies on issues of national identity and gender in Spanish cinema. <br>-A glossary of technical terms in English and Spanish, as well as bibliographies of both English and Spanish works.</p></p><p><p>Barry Jordan is Professor of European Cinema and Culture at De Montfort University, Leicester. </p><p>Mark Allinson is Professor of Spanish, University of Leicester.</p>"Excellent idea."&#x2014; Dr N Triana-Toribio, Professor of Spanish,&nbsp;University of Manchester</p><h2>Lord and Peasant in Russia from the Ninth to the Nineteenth Century</h2><p><p>To understand Russian history without understanding serfdom--the peasant-lord relationship that shaped Russia for centuries--is impossible. Still, before Jerome Blum, no scholar had tackled the subject in depth. Monumental in scope and pathbreaking in its analysis, <i>Lord and Peasant in Russia</i> garnered immediate attention upon its publication in 1961, a year that also marked the one hundredth anniversary of the emancipation of the Russian serfs. As one reviewer remarked, "No better book on the subject exists; it is indispensable to the serious student of Russia.?</p><br><p> On a scale befitting Russia--a sixth of the earth's land mass--Blum's book explored in almost seven hundred pages the legal and social evolution of its predominantly agricultural population, the types of peasant status, and the multifaceted nature of the master-peasant relationship. More important, Blum was the first to articulate the necessity of placing serfs front and center in the study of Russian history. As a reviewer for the <i>Economist</i> wrote, "Mr. Blum has written not just a monograph on landlords and peasants in Russia but a history of Russia from a particular point of view. There is no denying that the history of a country where . . . a bare 13 percent of the population was urban can with impunity be written in terms of landlords and peasants." In 1962, it was awarded the Herbert Baxter Adams Prize of the American Historical Association; it remains a cornerstone of Russian historiography.</p></p><p></p><h2>John Milton&#39;s Paradise Lost</h2><p>John Milton's Paradise Lost reveals much about the relationship between God, the world, and the human race.

Chronicling the negative consequences of forced assimilation and the failure of current educational policies to bolster the social and economic conditions of Aboriginal populations, Battiste proposes a new model of education. She argues that the preservation of Aboriginal knowledge is an Aboriginal right and a right preserved by the many treaties with First Nations. Current educational policies must undergo substantive reform. Central to this process is the rejection of the racism inherent to colonial systems of education, and the repositioning of Indigenous humanities, sciences, and languages as vital fields of knowledge. Battiste suggests the urgency for this reform lies in the social, technological, and economic challenges facing society today, and the need for a revitalized knowledge system which incorporates both Indigenous and Eurocentric thinking.

Not sure who she can trust,Quinn flees her controlling employers and sets out to discover who shereally is, uncovering far more than she could imagine. Quinn is asympathetic character, and readers will want her and fellowcloser-on-the-run Deacon to succeed in their mission and theirrelationship. Young's latest book perfectly illustrates how goodintentions can lead to horrible results. An effort to save people frompain and grief actually causes much more damage than simply lettingpeople feel hurt. <i>The Epidemic</i> is the sequel to <i>The Remedy </i>(Simon Pulse, 2015/<i>Voya</i> April 2015), and both novels serve as companion books that lead to the events in Young's popular <i>Program</i> duology. Although this new duology can stand on its own, teens who have read <i>The Program</i> (Simon Pulse, 2013/<i>Voya</i> April 2013) and <i>The Treatment </i>(Simon Pulse, 2014/<i>Voya</i> June 2014) already will finish <i>The Epidemic</i> with a deeper understanding of how and why society could wind up like it does.

When she's not traipsing after a rabbit into Wonderland, she's gallivanting off into the topsy-turvy world behind the drawing-room looking glass. In <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, Lewis Carroll's masterful and zany sequel to <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, she makes more eccentric acquaintances, including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the White Queen, and a somewhat grumpy Humpty Dumpty. Through a giant and elaborate chess game, Alice explores this odd country, where one must eat dry biscuits to quench thirst, and run like the wind to stay in one place. As in life, Alice must stay on her toes to learn the rules of this game. <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> immediately took its rightful place beside its partner on the shelf of eternal classics. And luckily for generations of enraptured children, Carroll was again able to persuade John Tenniel to create the fantastic woodblock engravings that have become so indelibly associated with the Alice stories. For almost 130 years, Alice's curious adventures have amused, perplexed, and delighted readers, young and old. This gorgeous, deluxe boxed set of both volumes contains engravings from Tenniel's original woodblocks that were discovered in a London bank in 1985, and reproduced for the first time here. "'What is the use of a book,' thought Alice, 'without pictures?'" What indeed? (All ages)Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Covering the country's history from the founding of the English colonies up through the latest decisions of the Supreme Court, this two-volume work presents the most complete discussion of American constitutional history currently available. Reflecting the latest in contemporary scholarship, the authors successfully blend cases and court doctrines into the larger fabric of American political, economic, and social history. They discuss in detail the great cases handed down by the Supreme Court, showing how these cases played out in society and how constitutional growth parallels changes in American culture. In addition, this two-volume set examines lesser-known decisions that played important roles in affecting change, and also contains in-depth analyses of the intellects and personalities of the Supreme Court justices who made these influential decisions.<br> This second edition of <em>A March of Liberty</em> addresses recent scholarship on race and gender, covers both constitutional and legal history, and examines federal, state, and private law. The text exemplifies the current trends in American constitutional history through its holistic approach of integrating the decisions of the state and lower federal courts with the decisions of the Supreme Court. Volume I covers the colonial period up through Reconstruction and explores central rulings on property law, religious freedom, slavery, and women's rights. It also examines the need for a governmental system of checks and balances, lesser-known rulings on land and water usage, and impeachment and treason trials.<br> <em>A March of Liberty, 2/e</em>, features useful supplemental materials including the text of the Constitution, a chronological list of Supreme Court justices, and suggested further readings. Gracefully written and clearly explained, this popular two-volume set is indispensable for courses in American constitutional history and law.</p><p><br>Melvin Urofsky is Professor of History and Public Policy at Virginia Commonwealth University.<br> Paul Finkelman is Chapman Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of Tulsa.<br><br>"I have the greatest admiration for <em>A March of Liberty's</em> comprehensiveness and its clarity.

Dunwell presents a rich portrait of the Hudson and of the visionary people whose deep relationship with the river inspires changes in American history and culture. Lavishly illustrated with color plates of Hudson River School paintings, period engravings, and glass plate photography, The Hudson captures the spirit of the river through the eyes of its many admirers. It shows the crucial role of the Hudson in the shaping of Manhattan, the rise of the Empire State, and the trajectory of world trade and global politics, as well as the river&#39;s influence on art and architecture, engineering, and conservation.</p><p>Frances F. Dunwell is the author of <i>Hudson River Highlands</i> and has spent over thirty years in a number of nonprofit and governmental positions dedicated to conserving the natural and historic heritage of the Hudson River.*Starred Review* The magnificent Hudson River is emblematic of America&#x2019;s dreams of freedom, bountiful nature, and uplifting beauty. And yet, for all its wild splendor and historic sites, America&#x2019;s &#x201c;most important waterway&#x201d; became &#x201c;grossly polluted.&#x201d; Dunwell, a key figure in the river&#x2019;s conservation, reawakens appreciation for the Hudson in a richly illustrated book graceful and capacious enough to capture the spirit and significance of its&nbsp;subject. Combining natural and human history, Dunwell tracks the river from its Adirondack headwaters to the tip of Manhattan, from Revolutionary War battles to Millionaire&#x2019;s Row, where such prominent families as the Roosevelts and Rockefellers built grand estates, to the industries that poisoned the river&nbsp;and the activists&#x2014;among them Pete Seeger, with the sloop Clearwater&#x2014;who rescued, restored, and continue to protect the Hudson.&nbsp; Dunwell&#x2019;s clear, fast-moving prose conveys a wealth of information to form a commanding and inspiring biography of a river that gave rise to an art movement (the Hudson River school), progressive social quests,&nbsp;landmark environmental cases, and heroic&nbsp;approaches to&nbsp;preservation. The story of the Hudson River is the story of nature&#x2019;s resiliency and civilization&#x2019;s evolution. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Database Systems: Introduction to Databases and Data Warehouses</h2><p><p> <i>An introductory, yet comprehensive, database textbook intended for use in undergraduate and graduate information systems database courses.

Nearly every successful company came from meager </p><p>beginnings, and Taylor Guitars is no exception. In 1974, Bob Taylor and his partner, Kurt Listug, then just a couple of kids, embarked on a journey to own their own guitar company. They instantly found themselves tempest-tossed, bailing water out of a leak-prone workshop, constantly struggling to make a buck, and tackling ever more complex problems. </p><p>Taylor shares each epiphany, each nugget of wisdom that encouraged him to overcome the obstacles, shaped his knowledge of manufacturing, and helped him transform his passion into a lucrative business. Today, Taylor Guitars is one of the world's most successful and highly regarded acoustic and electric guitar manufacturers.

Longing to own a 12-string guitar but unable to afford one, Taylor built his first guitar in shop class during his junior year of high school. As his desire to make music and his talent for building things converged, Taylor experienced an epiphany that revealed his vocational path. He had discovered that making guitars would be his life's work, even though he had no real blueprint to guide him. </p> <p>In Guitar Lessons, Taylor shares stories of how a lifelong passion led to a pioneering business. From his humble beginnings at a guitar shop near San Diego, aptly named The American Dream, through the early struggles of founding and sustaining Taylor Guitars with his business partner, Kurt Listug (who's still CEO today), Taylor recounts the valuable lessons that enabled two driven "kids" to overcome formidable obstacles and grow their small guitar shop into a world-renowned guitar brand. </p><p>Today, Taylors are the guitars of choice for serious musicians. Players as diverse in style as Dave Matthews, Prince, Zac Brown, Jason Mraz, Neil Young, Taylor Swift, and many more of today's biggest names proudly strum their Taylors both onstage and in the studio. Along with these stars, thousands and thousands of other musicians&#x2014;pro and amateur&#x2014;choose Taylor. This wasn't always so. Guitar Lessons takes you back to when the company was just a handful of devoted craftsmen working with little more than pluck and perseverance to breathe life into their fledgling enterprise, learning hard lessons about business and life along the way that would pay off years later. </p><p>Through anecdotes that blend self-deprecating wit with grassroots wisdom, Bob Taylor reflects on the key experiences and personal revelations that nurtured the company's growth. Guitar Lessons will give you a fresh perspective on how the fundamental values of hard work and determination can be applied to overcome challenges in business and life, leading to success and personal fulfillment. Amid today's mass-production culture, Taylor's philosophy as a modern-day craftsman and respected leader serves as a compass for "crafting" a meaningful life. </p><p>Many people try to take their passion and turn it into a business. Many fail. Some sell out along the way. Bob Taylor found his love as a teenager, worked hard at it, and created a profitable, growing enterprise, which he still happily stewards alongside Listug.

Now, thirty years later, one book recounts the harrowing story&#x2015;and offers some measure of closure on this decades-old mystery.<br><br>Because of the covert nature of the mission at Lima Site 85&#x2015;providing bombing instructions to U.S. Air Force tactical aircraft from the "safe harbor" of a nation that was supposedly neutral&#x2015;the wives of the eleven servicemen were warned in no uncertain terms never to discuss the truth about their husbands. But one wife, Ann Holland, refused to remain silent. Timothy Castle draws on her personal records and recollections as well as upon a wealth of interviews with surviving servicemen and recently declassified information to tell the full story.<br><br>The result is a tale worthy of Tom Clancy but told by a scholar with meticulous attention to historical accuracy. More than just an account of government deception, <i>One Day Too Long</i> is the story of the courageous men who agreed to put their lives in danger to perform a critical mission in which they could not be officially acknowledged. Indeed the personnel at Site 85 agreed to be "sheep-dipped"&#x2015;removed from their military status and technically placed in the employ of a civilian company. <br><br>Castle reveals how the program, code-named "Heavy Green," was conceived and approved at the highest levels of the U.S. government. In spine tingling detail, he describes the selection of the men and the construction and operation of the radar facility on a mile-high cliff in neutral Laos, even as the North Vietnamese Army began encircling the mountain. He chronicles the communist air attack on Site 85, the only such aerial bombing of the entire Vietnam War. <br><br>A saga of courage, cover-up, and intrigue <i>One Day Too Long</i> tells how, in a shocking betrayal of trust, for thirty years the U.S. government has sought to hide the facts and now seeks to acquiesce to perfidious Vietnamese explanations for the disappearance of eleven good men.</p><p>From October 1967 to March 1968, the United States operated a top-secret radar system in Laos near that country's border with North Vietnam. This was a provocative move: Laos was a neutral country. Yet the air force desperately needed all-weather bombing capability in the region, and so the Pentagon decided to take a chance. When Communist troops learned of Site 85, they hit it hard. The result: "The largest single ground combat loss of U.S. Air Force personnel in the history of the Vietnam War." <p> The public still does not know what happened to nine of the men posted at Site 85. They may have been killed or captured, or perhaps fell victim to "some atrocity" perpetrated by the Communists. The military establishment isn't talking, and neither are knowledgeable sources in Laos and Vietnam. <i>One Day Too Long</i> combines scholarship, journalism, and detective work to learn all that can be known. Apparently there is plenty to hide. "It was criminal to leave the technicians and the other Americans and their security forces stranded [at Site 85]," writes Castle. Yet one conclusion is certain, he says: there is "an unseemly pattern of U.S. government duplicity" surrounding this forgotten incident. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>The incident at the heart of this book reveals in microcosm what went wrong in Vietnam, from the highest policy-making levels down the chain of command to what actually transpired on the field. On March 10, 1968, seven U.S. servicemen disappeared from a top secret radar base in Laos, their loss never fully explained by the American government. Castle recounts a harrowing story--of government coverups, military miscalculations, and crucial policy errors.</p><h2>The Jew in the Modern World: A Documentary History</h2><p>A collection of 200 essays, by wellknown and unknown Jews and non-Jews, inquiring into the Jewish identity, anti-Semitism, the Russian and American experiences, and the Holocaust</p><p><br><strong>Paul Mendes-Flohr</strong> is Professor of Modern Jewish Thought in the Divinity School and an associate member of the department of history at the University of Chicago.

She describes the body as the container of one&#39;s entire life experience and movement as a language that expresses and reveals our deepest struggles and creative potentials. Interweaving artistic and psychological processes, she offers a philosophy and methodology that invites the reader to consider the transformational capacity of the arts. In this essential resource for anyone interested in the integration of psychotherapy and the arts, Halprin also presents case studies and a selection of exercises that she has evolved over her career and practised at the Tamalpa Institute for over twenty-five years.</p><p>Daria Halprin trained since early childhood as a dancer and performance artist and toured internationally in the Dancers&#39; Workshop Company. She has appeared in several films, most noteably in Antonioni&#39;s Zabriskie Point. She studied with Fritz Perls, the originator of Gestalt therapy, which led to her interest in psychology. In 1978 she co-founded the Tamalpa Institute, the first training center for movement-based expressive arts therapy, where she developed and codified her approach. She holds a Masters degree in psychology, is a Gestalt therapist and a registered expressive arts therapist. She conducts trainings at the Tamalpa Institute, teaches internationally and has a private practice in Marin County, California.In this book is an introductory guide for newcomers to the field of expressive therapy. It includes many concrete examples of Halprin's method in visual illustrations and through a variety of therapeutic excercises. One of the highlights of expressive therapy is its embrace of multiplicity fuelling an initiation into de-territorialised spaces of mind and body, where anything can happen. Author: The Canadian Art Therapy Association Journal<br><br>This book marks, I believe, the period of the coming of age of expressive arts therapy in relation to our global society. It makes a significant contribution to practitioners, students and teachers in this field, and it also makes a broader contribution to what is referred to as "living artfully in a fragmented world." Anyone walking the path of growth and transformation will benefit from this embodied, arts based approach. For me, and I hope for all of us, the arrival of this book is cause for celebration! Author: Jack S. Weller<br><br>It is clear from Halprin's writings that her work is not only about self-preservation, but also about preservation of this beautiful planet we depend upon to nurture our souls daily. Given the disembodied age we are entering with advanced technologies, she believes it is expressive artist's ethical obligation to reintroduce the arts back into daily living. Reading her book will indeed inspire those inclined, to hear the message and respond to the call. Author: Beth Lucchi, American Dance Therapy Association</p><h2>The Kaiser's daughter: Memoirs of H.

It is a plain-spoken poetry of immediate day-to-day experience, and yet seems most akin to China's grand landscape paintings. Although its wisdom is ancient, rooted in Taoist and Ch'an (Zen) thought, this work feels utterly contemporary, especially as rendered here in David Hinton's wonderful and accessible translations.<br>The rivers-and-mountains tradition embraces a remarkable range of topics: comic domestic scenes, social protest, travelogue, and sage recluses shaping mountain landscapes into forms of enlightenment. But throughout that range, these poems articulate the experience of living as an organic part of the natural world. And in an age of global ecological disruption and mass extinction, this tradition grows more urgently and universally important by the day.<br>Mountain Home begins with an introduction, which explains China's vision of wilderness as the fundamental cosmological model of reality. The poems follow the rivers-and-mountains tradition from its origins in the 5th century C.E. through the Sung Dynasty (13th century), the period during which it opened all of its possibilities. The development of this tradition is traced in concise introductions to each of the nineteen poets translated. As wilderness is the heart of Chinese poetry, this group includes virtually all of ancient China's greatest poets. Indeed, this may well be the finest general collection of ancient Chinese poetry available in English. These breathtaking translations offer a new poetry that will charm and inform not just readers of poetry, but also the large communities interested in environmental awareness or Chinese spirituality.</p><p>David Hinton&#39;s many translations of ancient Chinese poetry have earned wide acclaim for creating compelling English poetry that conveys the actual texture and density of the originals. He has held numerous fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. And in 1997, his work was awarded the Landon Translation Award from the Academy of American Poets. He lives in East Calais, Vermont.Translator and scholar Hinton ensures that Western readers will experience this supreme collection of Chinese rivers-and-mountains (<i>shan-shui</i>) poetry at the deepest possible level by succinctly explaining the cosmology inherent in this vital and profoundly influential tradition. The keys to understanding the elegant poetry of such masters as T'ao Ch'ien (365-427), Li Po (701-762), and Lu Yu (1125-1210) are realizing that they perceive no divide between the human and what we call nature, or between being and nonbeing, and recognizing that in Taoist thought existence is an ongoing process of transformation "through which all things arise and pass away." The path taken in most of these deceptively simple lyrics leads away from the clamor of the city back to life's sweet essences: the flow of water, the play of shadows and sunshine on mountain and field, the moon's phases, and the great wheel of the seasons. Oneness with life at its purest is the desired mode for these thoughtful, yet often playful, poets, and dwelling within these meditative pages is the first step on the way there. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

As quality education of the young becomes the true international currency, that commodity--unfortunately--is in grievously short supply. American schoolchildren lag far behind students in most of the developed world, scoring nineteenth out of twenty-one countries in a recent math competition. On domestic exams, almost forty percent are reading at "below basic" levels. </p><p> In this candid, provocative, and comprehensive study of the public school system, from kindergarten through high school, bestselling author Martin L. Gross charges that the Education Establishment has nurtured a conspiracy of ignorance that promotes and defends lower standards of teaching and learning designed to maintain its monopoly on our public schools. </p><p> The verdict is in: The teaching vocation has failed to produce competent teachers, penalizing its 45 million public school students. The problem is that the Establishment--from a tight group of teachers, principals, superintendents, education professors, and counselors, to the state commissioners of education--selects mainly academically inferior teacher candidates, and ignoring time-tested fundamentals, trains them in such dubious concepts as "educational psychology" and a "whole language" method of reading that ignores proper grammar and spelling. </p><p> In a series of shocking revelations, Mr. Gross describes how the typical teacher learns little more than a two-year community college graduate; how the average college-bound student scores fifty points higher on his SAT exams than most of his teachers; how the great majority of school teachers are less trained in their own specialties than other college graduates in the same field; and how "untrained" teachers in both private and public schools perform better than Establishment graduates.</p><p> The usual remedies--from federal aid to smaller class sizes--have done nothing to alleviate these problems because they make no attempt to challenge the Education Establishment's control. In a powerful Bill of Indictment, Mr. Gross shows how the teaching vocation, aided by its unions, maintains a self-perpetuating cycle of low performance, and he offers his own detailed prescription for change that will raise public education to the level our children--and society--need and deserve.</p><p> <em> The Conspiracy of Ignorance</em> is a lucid, persuasive argument based on a wealth of research that asks the questions most education observers are afraid to ask. It is a book desperately needed to ensure that American schoolchildren will have a chance to prosper as educated and productive citizens in today's world. </p></p><p>Martin L. Gross has made a career out of books that attack "the establishment," whether it be the medical community (<i>The Doctors</i>) or the general powers that be (<i>The Government Racket</i>). In <i>The Conspiracy of Ignorance</i>, he takes aim at a lumbering, elephant-sized target: public education. Armed with statistics and research papers--the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) being his most prominent sources--Gross rails against the declining performance of U.S. students. While his criticisms--which encompass everything from teachers' unions to "useless" education degrees, PTAs, psychological services in schools, even honor roll bumper stickers--are not new, they make an imposing indictment when presented all together.<p> Gross poses a number of radical solutions, including the elimination of undergraduate schools of education (replaced by a one-year postgraduate course that prepares scholars to become teachers in their specialty). He believes the entire education system should--and can--be overhauled without spending any more than at present. One of his suggestions to make funds available for reform is to cut support personnel, but he doesn't address how schools would then clean themselves without custodians or how high school crime would be affected by the loss of security guards and police officers. While Gross's tendency to use his own high school experience as a model of excellence grows tiresome, his points are well taken. <i>The Conspiracy of Ignorance</i> will have you either nodding in agreement or aching to wring the author's neck. <i>--Jodi Mailander Farrell</i></p><p>Martin L.

While devoting attention to women of all classes, religions, and ethnicities, the text examines political, economic, intellectual, and social history through the lens of gender. The narrative emphasizes women&#39;s agency over oppression and makes cutting-edge scholarship in women&#39;s history accessible to a wide audience. Five major themes run throughout the narrative: the relationship between key historical events and ideas and women&#39;s lives, the history of the family and sexuality, the social construction of gender, cultural assumptions about women (versus their actual lives), and self perception and women&#39;s place in western societies. A rich collection of primary sources and biographies reinforces these themes.</p><p>1. Unearthing Gender in the Ancient Mediterranean, to 600 B.C.E. 2. Ancient Greece, 3100-150 B.C.E. 3.

And Kevin J. Anderson and Daniel Wallace don't disappoint. Their accurately named <i>Essential Chronology</i> satisfies all but the most rabid fan-boy needs, cataloging every significant event from the Golden Age of the Sith (roughly 5,000 years B.B.Y., Before the Battle of Yavin) through to the exploits of the Young Jedi in 24 A.B.Y. (immediately preceding the events of Del Rey's New Jedi Order story arc).<p> In encyclopedic style, the duo have compiled the periods and players from what's become a sprawl of comics, computer games, newspaper strips, "audio adventures," and paperbacks. Some niggling details, of course, slip through the cracks, but the end product succeeds admirably, proving to be both entertaining and useful. The icing on the cake?

The disadvantages include limitations on speed, operating range, and convenience as well as the high cost of converting existing vehicles to electric operation; while acknowledging such other disadvantages as lack of effective heating, air conditioning, and power steering, EV advocate Brant says some of the best-known ones are myths. Speed, for instance, is related to body weight, and less weight means more speed. (Weight is, however, also a factor in safety: lighter weight often means less safety, especially in collisions, and Brant doesn't mention the collision factor.) Brant provides comprehensive instruction in converting a vehicle to electric power. It is not for the casual hobbyist, though, as is evident in such features as formulas for divining the potential top-end speeds of specific EVs--a precise system to answer questions of speed, but hardly the simple ballpark figure casual readers interested in exploring EVs' possibilities might want. <i>Mike Tribby</i></p><h2>Elementary and Intermediate Algebra: Graphs and Models (4th Edition)</h2><p>The <b>Bittinger Graphs and Models Series</b> helps readers learn algebra by making connections between mathematical concepts and their real-world applications.

While at a General Electric plant in early 2014, Obama remarked, "I promise you, folks can make a lot more, potentially, with skilled manufacturing or the trades than they might with an art history degree." These messages are hitting home: majors like English and history, once very popular and highly respected, are in steep decline.</p><p>"I get it," writes Fareed Zakaria, recalling the atmosphere in India where he grew up, which was even more obsessed with getting a skills-based education. However, the CNN host and best-selling author explains why this widely held view is mistaken and shortsighted.</p><p>Zakaria eloquently expounds on the virtues of a liberal arts education&#x2015;how to write clearly, how to express yourself convincingly, and how to think analytically.

It is meant for every investor who has ever wished for the skills required to deal with an increasingly volatile and uncertain stock market. It is meant for every investor willing to take responsibility for the outcome of his own investments. It is meant for every investor ready to take at least some of the time and to put forth at least some of the effort required for the quest.</p><p>The stock market tends to condition investors to make the wrong decisions at the wrong times. For instance, the stock market explosion of the late 1920s convinced investors that the only path for stocks was up, and that the prospects of stocks rising indefinitely justified even the high levels of margin leverage that could be employed at the time. </p><p>Investors plowed in, the stock market collapsed, and, thereafter, the public remained fearful of stocks for 20 years, although the stock market actually reached its lows during 1931 and 1932. In the mid-1990s, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index was king and index mutual funds were the royal coach. Between 1996 and 1998, huge inflows of capital were injected into Standard &amp; Poor's 500&#x2013;based index mutual funds, such as those sponsored by Vanguard. The largest inflows took place just before a serious intermediate market decline in mid-1998. The market advance that followed that decline was headed not by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 sector of the stock market, but by speculative areas of the Nasdaq Composite: technology sectors (Internet issues and the like) that, in some cases, sold for hundreds of dollars per share, even though many companies had no earnings whatsoever. And then came the crash, in March of 2000. The Nasdaq Composite ultimately declined by more than 77%.</p><p>So, investors returned to the sanctity of total return, value, earnings, and dividends, not the worst strategy during the bear market that took place between 2000 and 2002, but definitely not the best of strategies when the new bull market more clearly emerged during the spring of 2003. The play returned to technology and the Internet, with growth back in and total return back out. (During the first nine months of 2004, however, technology issues once again lost market leadership to value- and income-oriented market sectors.) </p><p>The point, of course, is that the typical investor follows and does not lead trends, is late rather than early, and is a crowd-follower rather than a self-director. According to Dalbar, Inc., a financial services research firm, the average equity fund investor realized an annualized return of 5.32% between 1984 and 2000, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index rose at a rate of 16.3% per annum. Matters become even worse when comparisons are updated through July 2003. The average investor was ahead by only 2.6% per year for the 1984&#x2013;2003 period, compared to annualized returns of 12.2% for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index. </p><p>This book has been prepared to help investors achieve better than average performance&#x2014;considerably better, we believe.</p><p>The structure of <i>Technical Analysis</i> has been designed to provide information and investment tools, some of which can be put to work immediately, by both sophisticated and relatively unsophisticated stock market investors. I will share with you, right at the start, my favorite techniques for picking mutual funds and ETFs (securities that trade on the stock exchange and act similarly to market index mutual funds but provide greater investment flexibility at lower ongoing internal management fees, though, possibly, with some initial commission expense, which is often involved with mutual funds as well). </p><p>We move from there to some of the basic tools stock market technicians use to track and predict market behavior. A certain amount of statistical calculations is required in applying some of the "practical power tools" you will be learning&#x2014;nothing truly complex. I have placed a strong emphasis on the "practical" in "practical power tools." The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle is observed throughout the book&#x2014;at least, to the best of my ability. </p><p>For example, in Chapter 1, "The No-Frills Investment Strategy," I show you two indicators that, together, should require no more than five or ten minutes for you to post and maintain each week&#x2014;that's right, each week, not each day. These have a fine history of helping investors discriminate between favorable and unfavorable market climates. Nothing in the stock market can ever be guaranteed for the future, of course, but you will see how powerful these two simple indicators have been during more than three decades of stock market history in supplementing your selections for market investment with straightforward but surprisingly effective market-timing strategies. </p><p>Even if you go no further, you will have already acquired a useful arsenal of tools for improved investment results. By this time, you might well have become ready for additional, more involved technical tools that I have found over the decades to be more than useful in my own investment decisions. These include, for example, T-formations, special time-based patterns of market movement that frequently provide advance notice of when market turning points are likely to occur. In a subsequent chapter, you learn about the application of moving average trading channels, a technique for employing certain patterns of past market behavior to predict likely patterns for the future.</p><p>Finally, you get my personal take on Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD), an indicator that I invented in the late 1970s and, since then, has become one of the most widely followed of market-forecasting tools employed by technical analysts, private and professional. You will learn how to maintain the MACD indicator and how to interpret it for time frames ranging from 15 minutes (for day trading) to many years (for long-term investing). </p><p>Each of these indicators alone can be quite powerful, particularly as you develop the facility for combining various elements of your trading strategy for disciplined decision-making, higher returns, and less risk. Synergy helps the cause. I will show you many ways to achieve this synergy. </p><p>All in all, <i>Technical Analysis</i> is about the best stock-market timing tools that I have learned in nearly 40 years of studying, trading in, and writing about the stock market. These are real tools, practical tools, tools that my staff and I employ every day in tracking the stock market and investing our own and our clients' capital. These are tools that you, yourself, can begin to employ almost immediately. </p><p>There will be some additional interesting side trips and excursions along the way, but I think that we will conclude the description of our itinerary at this point. The time has come to begin the journey....</p><br><p>ï¿½ Copyright Pearson Education.

Public interest in this lively field has been stimulated by environmental concerns and through links with the histories of art, collecting and gardening. The centrality of the development of natural history for other branches of history - medical, colonial, gender, economic, ecological - is increasingly recognized. Twenty-four specially commissioned essays cover the period from the sixteenth century, when the first institutions of natural history were created, to its late nineteenth-century transformation by practitioners of the new biological sciences. An introduction discusses novel approaches that have made this a major focus for research in cultural history. The essays, which include suggestions for further reading, offer a coherent and accessible overview of a fascinating subject. An epilogue highlights the relevance of this wide-ranging survey for current debates on museum practice, the display of ecological diversity and concerns about the environment."The 26 papers in this remarkable collection study, without jargon and very little special pleading, some of the principal liaisons contracted by natural history during the past five centuries....contains fresh, vigorous essays on the tried and true topics..."

Now David and Leigh Eddings take us on a fascinating behind-the-scenes tour of the extensive background materials they compiled before beginning the masterpiece of epic fantasy unforgettably set down in The Belgariad and The Malloreon and their two companion volumes, Belgarath the Sorcerer and Polgara the Sorceress.<br><br>Our tour stretches from the wealthy Empire of Tolnedra to the remote Isle of the Winds, from the mysterious mountains of Ulgoland to the forbidding reaches of darkest Mallorea. We will visit the time before Time when two opposing Destinies began the cataclysmic struggle for supremacy that would involve Gods and men alike, crack a world asunder, and threaten to unravel the fabric of the universe itself. We will see the origin of the Orb of Aldur and glimpse the final act upon the Sardion Stone.<br><br>Along the way, we will stop to greet old friends: Belgarath, the Old Wolf, disciple of the god Aldur; Polgara, his enigmatic daughter; brave Belgarion, the Rivan King; and his beautiful Queen, Ce'Nedra. Old enemies will be waiting, too: the maimed god Torak, evil incarnate; Zandramas, fearsome Child of the Dark; and the tragically corrupted traitor, Belzedar.<br><br>Rare volumes will be opened to your eyes. Sacred holy books in which you may read the secrets of the Gods themselves and of their prophets. Scholarly histories of the rise and fall of empires from the Imperial Library at Tol Honeth. The profound mysteries of the Malloreon Gospels.<br><br>Brimming with the adventure, romance, and excitement readers have come to expect from David and Leigh Eddings--including invaluable advice for aspiring writers on how and how not to create their own fantasy worlds--The Rivan Codex will enrich your understanding of all that has gone before . . . and whet your appetite for all that is yet to come.</p><p>So you want to write a multivolume, bestselling epic fantasy? Here's the book to help you. <i>The Rivan Codex</i> was published to answer the many letters David and Leigh Eddings have received from students, teachers, and aspiring writers. It's a companion to the 12-book fantasy series comprised of The Belgariad (five books), The Malloreon (five books), <i>Belgarath the Sorcerer</i> and <i>Polgara the Sorceress</i>. In David Eddings's words, <i>The Rivan Codex</i> "may give the student of our genre some insights into the creative process--something on the order of 'connect wire A to wire B. Warning! Do not connect wire A to wire C, because that will cause the whole thing to blow up in your face." This is a collection of the groundwork David and Leigh Eddings laid for the Belgariad and Malloreon series. On this firm foundation they imagined and built their world in book after book. <p> There's a fascinating introduction, a personal history of Belgarath the sorcerer, Holy Books, Gospels, Histories, King Anheg's diary, and an afterword. Footnotes tell how the authors used and changed these materials in writing the books. And of course, there are plenty of maps (the starting point for all epic fantasies). <i>--Nona Vero</i></p><br>Truth to tell, I'd give anything for a new Eddings novel, a new world where David and Leigh can work the magic they did with The Belgariad and The Malloreon, The Elenium and The Tamuli. There's nothing like an Eddings adventure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while the Eddings are busy inventing a new world and peopling it with heroes and vallains and just-plain-folks (skulking and otherwise), it's nice to peek behind the scenes and see what went into inventing the world of The Belgariad. It helps you appreciate why it does take so long to start a truly new series. And, as one of the first people to see the rough material of this book said--how did she put it?--it's actually very giving of Dave to share this much of the creative process with his readers. And as impatient as we all are for a new adventure, I think we've got time to sit and reminisce with old friends...<br><p>--Veronica Chapman, Senior Editor</p></p><h2>Singing School: Learning to Write (and Read) Poetry by Studying with the Masters</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Magnificent . . . poems to inspire [with] brief and brilliant, offhand notes about how to read them.&#x201d;&#x2015;Alan Cheuse, NPR</strong></p> Quick, joyful, and playfully astringent, with surprising comparisons and examples, this collection takes an unconventional approach to the art of poetry. Instead of rules, theories, or recipes, <em>Singing School</em> emphasizes ways to learn from great work: studying magnificent, monumentally enduring poems and how they are made&#x2015; in terms borrowed from the &#x201c;singing school&#x201d; of William Butler Yeats&#x2019;s &#x201c;Sailing to Byzantium.&#x201d; <p>Robert Pinsky&#x2019;s headnotes for each of the 80 poems and his brief introductions to each section take a writer&#x2019;s view of specific works: William Carlos Williams&#x2019;s &#x201c;Fine Work with Pitch and Copper&#x201d; for intense verbal music; Emily Dickinson&#x2019;s &#x201c;Because I Could Not Stop for Death&#x201d; for wild imagination in matter-of-fact language; Robert Southwell&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Burning Babe&#x201d; for surrealist aplomb; Wallace Stevens&#x2019;s &#x201c;The House Was Quiet and the World Was Calm&#x201d; for subtlety in meter. Included are poems by Aphra Behn, Allen Ginsberg, George Herbert, John Keats, Mina Loy, Thomas Nashe, and many other master poets.</p><p>This anthology respects poetry&#x2019;s mysteries in two senses of the word: techniques of craft and strokes of the inexplicable.</p></p><p>Robert Pinsky is the author of ten collections of poetry including, most recently, At the Foundling Hospital. His translation The Inferno of Dante won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize in Poetry. His brief guide The Sounds of Poetry is used in acting classes. As a three-term United States Poet Laureate, Pinsky founded the Favorite Poem Project, in which thousands of Americans shared their favorite poems. That project gave rise to three previous anthologies, Americans&#x2019; Favorite Poems, An Invitation to Poetry, and Singing School. Pinsky lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and teaches at Boston University.In this sparkling teaching anthology, Pinsky&#x2014;poet, poet laureate (1997&#x2013;2000), and poetry editor for Slate&#x2014;focuses on how poets read poetry in order to learn how to write poetry, taking his instructive title from William Butler Yeats: &#x201c;Nor is there singing school but studying / Monuments of its own magnificence.&#x201d; Pinsky has selected a tremendously fresh and exciting variety of salient poems and organized them into sections titled &#x201c;Freedom,&#x201d; &#x201c;Listening,&#x201d; &#x201c;Form,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Dreaming Things Up.&#x201d; He introduces each of the 80 selections with an illuminating bit of analysis (Robert Frost is &#x201c;a sexier, more adventuresome poet than he may get credit for&#x201d;) and a challenge: Can you &#x201c;write something as master-of-fact, yet as far-out&#x201d; as Emily Dickinson? Knowledgeable and puckish, Pinsky seeks to foster a deeper sense of the meaning of words and a fuller understanding of their &#x201c;feel and aroma&#x201d; while praising the imagination for how it &#x201c;transfigures&#x201d; perception. With brief bios of the poets, from Sappho to Andrew Marvell, Langston Hughes, and Marianne Moore, this stimulating and creative guide will intrigue and enlighten everyone interested in poetry. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Visual Teams: Graphic Tools for Commitment, Innovation, and High Performance</h2><p><b>Graphic tools and visual solutions for team building and development</b> <p><i>Visual Teams</i> uses visual tools and methods to help teams&#x2015;both face-to-face and virtual&#x2015;reach high performance in today's work environment.

Yet it exerted such a profound influence on Italian cinema that all the best postwar directors had to come to terms with it, whether in seeming imitation (the early Olmi), in commercial exploitation (the middle Comencini) or in ostensible rejection (the recent Tavianis). Despite the reactionary pressures of the marketplace and the highly personalized visions of Fellini, Antonioni. And Visconti, Italian cinema has maintained its moral commitment to use the medium in socially responsible ways--if not to change the world, as the first neorealists hoped, then at least to move filmgoers to face the pressing economic, political, and human problems in their midst. From Rossellini's <i>Open City</i> (1945) to the Taviani brothers' <i>Night of the Shooting Stars</i> (1982). The author does close readings of seventeen films that tell the story of neorealism's evolving influence on Italian postwar cinematic expression.</p><br><p>Other films discussed are De Sica's <i>Bicycle Thief</i> and Umberto D. De Santis's <i>Bitter Rice</i>, Comencini's <i>Bread, Love, and Fantasy</i>, Fellini's <i>La strada</i>, Visconti's <i>Senso</i>, Antonioni's <i>Red Desert</i>, Olmi's <i>Il Posto</i>, Germi's <i>Seduced and Abandoned</i>, Pasolini's <i>Teorema</i>, Petri's <i>Investigation of a Citizen above Suspicion</i>, Bertolucci's <i>The Conformist</i>, Rosi's <i>Christ Stopped at Eboli</i>, and Wertmuller's <i>Love and Anarchy</i>, Scola's <i>We All Loved Each Other So Much</i> provides the occasion for the author's own retrospective consideration of how Italian cinema has fulfilled, or disappointed, the promise of neorealism.</p></p><p><p>"This is unquestionably one of the best works on Italian cinema I have read in any language. . . . an exceptional work that will become an instant classic on publication. It will be must reading for anyone interested in Italian culture in any way."<b>--Ben Lawton, Purdue University</b></p></p><h2>Point and Figure Charting: The Essential Application for Forecasting and Tracking Market Prices</h2><p>"Everyone who's involved in financial markets must understand Point and Figure charting in order to get the full picture, whatever your view of technical analysis". - Jim Rogers, author of Hot Commodities and Investment Biker<br> <br> "An invaluable road map for managing risk in the markets.

For more than three centuries, artists have captured the plantation in works that are both profoundly moving and deeply disturbing. Through their art, this Janus-faced memory of the American South and its black and white people touches our heart, as if three centuries were only a moment past. The images in this collection and the eloquent essays that accompany them remind us that our memory of the plantation is contested along racial lines that continue to divide our nation."--William R.

It is the supposed autobiography of an English gentleman who begins life as a child of the London streets. He and his brothers are brought up as pickpockets and highwaymen, but Jack seeks to improve himself. Kidnapped and taken to America, he becomes first a slave, then an overseer on plantations in Maryland. Jack&#x2019;s story is one of dramatic turns of fortune that ultimately lead to a life of law-abiding prosperity as a plantation owner. </p> <p> Historical appendices relate to eighteenth-century Virginia and Maryland and to contemporary crime, punishment, and imprisonment. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Gabriel Cervantes</strong> is Assistant Professor of English at the University of North Texas. </p> <p> <strong>Geoffrey Sill</strong> is Professor of English at Rutgers University and the co-editor of the Broadview Edition of Frances Burney&#x2019;s <em>The Witlings</em> and <em>The Woman-Hater</em>. </p><p> &#x201c;It is a pleasure to have an edition of Defoe&#x2019;s <em>Colonel Jack</em> available for use in the classroom. As the editors, Gabriel Cervantes and Geoffrey Sill, remark, there has been no edition of this novel available for decades. The introduction is a remarkable piece of original scholarship and criticism. The discussion of Jack&#x2019;s shifting concept of identity suggests Defoe&#x2019;s original approach to this subject; the comparison between Jack and the later slave, Frederick Douglas frames a rich discussion about the nature of servitude at the time; and the interesting reading of the illustrations later appended to Defoe&#x2019;s narrative as a way into discussing Jack&#x2019;s criminal boyhood and later repentance &amp; all provide suggestive openings into Defoe&#x2019;s work both for university students who may encounter it in a class and for the general reader. Professors Cervantes and Sill also provide an appendix with fascinating documents throwing light on the nature of transporting criminals to the North American colonies and critical assessments of <em>Colonel Jack</em>. They rightfully lament the neglect of this work and contribute to what will surely be a revival of critical interest in one of Defoe&#x2019;s best fictional narratives.&#x201d; &#x2015; Maximillian E. Novak, UCLA </p> <p> &#x201c;Jack cuts a wider swath across the social and political geography of his times than any of Defoe&#x2019;s other protagonists. Abandoned at birth, he rises from homeless London street urchin to wealthy Virginia planter. Along the way, by a &#x2018;long series of Changes and Turns,&#x2019; he is among other things a sneak thief and robber; kidnapped into slavery; the overseer and then master of slaves; a captive, variously, of the French and the Spanish; a parvenu returned to Europe intent on fashioning himself into a gentleman; an officer in the French army and then in the service of the Pretender; a fugitive who has not once but twice taken up arms against the English crown; a merchant engaged in illicit trade with Latin America; and five times the husband of four women in England, Italy, France, and Virginia, all of whom betray him. Of labile and elusive identity, he can pass for a Frenchman among his countrymen and a Spaniard among Spaniards. This scrupulous and meticulous edition provides, with its immensely useful annotation, rich and valuable historical context for an often undervalued novel.&#x201d; &#x2015; Lincoln Faller, University of Michigan </p> <p> &#x201c;<em>Colonel Jack</em>, the poor stepchild among the books of Defoe&#x2019;s major period of fiction writing, has finally gotten the modern edition it deserves. Freshly edited and splendidly introduced by Gabriel Cervantes and Geoffrey Sill, this edition has just the right mix of contemporary writings on trade, criminality, Jacobitism, and marriage to enable modern readers to recover the rich transatlantic world that Defoe inscribes.

Through several decades of writing, friendship remained a primary theme for them both.</p> <p>Collecting extracts from the letters and journals of both men, as well as words written about them by their contemporaries, Jeffrey S. Cramer beautifully illustrates the full nature of their twenty-five-year dialogue. Biographers like to point at the crisis in their friendship, focusing particularly on Thoreau's disappointment in Emerson&#x2015;rarely on Emerson's own disappointment in Thoreau&#x2015;and leaving it there, a friendship ruptured. But the solid seasons remained, as is evident when, in 1878, Anne Burrows Gilchrist, the English writer and friend of Whitman, visited Emerson. She wrote that his memory was failing "as to recent names and topics but as is usual in such cases all the mental impressions that were made when he was in full vigour remain clear and strong." As they chatted, Emerson called to his wife, Lidian, in the next room, "What was the name of my best friend?"</p> <p>"Henry Thoreau," she answered.<br> "Oh, yes," Emerson repeated.

The book slowly sifts and sorts and reshapes how we understand each man . . . It&#x2019;s an idiosyncratic book, a minimalist history, Thoreauvian in its desire to be just as it is, generous in the way it bares itself, full of trust that readers are smart enough to spin conclusions for themselves, and intense in its demand that they elevate themselves to the task." &#x2015;Daegan Miller, <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></p> <p>"The abiding strength of the tie between the two writers emerges as an animating presence in both men&#x2019;s journals and correspondence, which Cramer mines for quotations that allow each writer to give his own unmediated account of their friendship . . .

Her efforts to bring culture to the prairie village are met by a wall of gossip, greed, and petty small-minded bigotry. Lewis&#39;s complex and compelling work established him as an important character in American literature.<p>Nobel Prize-winning writer Sinclair Lewis (1885-1951) is best known for novels like Main Street, Babbitt, Arrowsmith (for which he was awarded but declined the Pulitzer Prize), and Elmer Gantry. A writer from his youth, Lewis wrote for and edited the Yale Literary Magazine while a student, and started his literary career writing popular stories for magazines and selling plots to other writers like Jack London. Lewis s talent for description and creating unique characters won him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1930, making him the first American writer to win the prestigious award. Considered to be one of the greats of American literature, Lewis was honoured with a Great Americans series postage stamp, and his work has been adapted for both stage and screen.</p></p><h2>Fixed Income Markets and Their Derivatives (Academic Press Advanced Finance)</h2><p>The third edition&nbsp;of this well-respected textbook continues the tradition of providing clear and concise explanations for fixed income securities, pricing, and markets.&nbsp;<i>Fixed Income Markets and Their Derivatives</i>&nbsp;matches well with fixed income securities courses.

A must-have for all active kids.<br><br>This handbook to fishing, boating, and water wildlife brings together Jim Arnosky's knowledge, skills, and talents in one wonderful package. Illustrated with his trademark watercolors, pen-and-ink drawings, and photographs, it is packed with information. Both the text and the art give directions and advice.<br>Fishing chapter includes how to choose and use fishing tackle; how to fish in lakes, streams, and the ocean; and how to catch and release fish. Color plates spotlight fish kids are most likely to see in each environment.<br></p><p>Gr. 4-6. Distilling experiences garnered from a lifetime of fishing, boating and wildlife observation, naturalist Arnosky offers outdoorsy readers a handbook that is as much memoir as vademecum. In an engaging mixture of personal anecdotes and practical tips, he covers the ins and outs of fresh- and saltwater fishing, with, in turn, bait, lures, and flies. He then moves on to the pleasures of messing about in small boats, and finishes with a chapter on safe, nondisruptive techniques for watching wildlife along shores and waterways. Illustrated with finished paintings, quick sketches from his notebooks (including several entire sample pages), and small but very sharp color photos, this fills in the basics on diverse topics from boating safety to artificial flies to sport fish and shore birds, while providing the sort of agreeable pleasure reading also found in Gary Paulsen's outdoor reminiscences. <i>John Peters</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

The third book in Mark Hitchcock&#39;s fascinating prophecy series explains the relevance of this prediction to today&#39;s world. First, he establishes how the current global scene sets the stage for this event and focuses on the identity of the invading nations (those mentioned in Ezekiel are like a Who&#39;s Who of Israel&#39;s current enemies). Hitchcock then considers the time and motives for their attack. Finally, he discusses God&#39;s dramatic intervention that will pave the way for the Antichrist&#39;s worldwide empire.</p><p>Mark Hitchcock graduated from Dallas Theological Seminary and has since pastored Faith Bible Church in Edmond, Oklahoma.

His family was rooted in local history: his great-grandfather, a Confederate colonel and state politician, was assassinated by a former partner in 1889, and his grandfather was a wealth lawyer who owned a railroad. When Faulkner was five his parents moved to Oxford, Mississippi, where he received a desultory education in local schools, dropping out of high school in 1915. Rejected for pilot training in the U.S. Army, he passed himself off as British and joined the Canadian Royal Air Force in 1918, but the war ended before he saw any service. After the war, he took some classes at the University of Mississippi and worked for a time at the university post office. Mostly, however, he educated himself by reading promiscuously.<br><br>Faulkner had begun writing poems when he was a schoolboy, and in 1924 he published a poetry collection, <b>The Marble Faun</b>, at his own expense. His literary aspirations were fueled by his close friendship with Sherwood Anderson, whom he met during a stay in New Orleans. Faulkner's first novel, <b>Soldier&#x2019;s Pay</b>, was published in 1926, followed a year later by <b>Mosquitoes</b>, a literary satire. His next book, <b>Flags in the Dust</b>, was heavily cut and rearranged at the publisher&#x2019;s insistence and appeared finally as <b>Sartoris</b> in 1929. In the meantime he had completed <b>The Sound and the Fury</b>, and when it appeared at the end of 1929 he had finished <b>Sanctuary</b> and was ready to begin writing <b>As I Lay Dying</b>. That same year he married Estelle Oldham, whom he had courted a decade earlier.<br><br>Although Faulkner gained literary acclaim from these and subsequent novels&#x2014;<b>Light in August</b> (1932), <b>Pylon</b> (1935), <b>Absalom, Absalom!</b> (1936), <b>The Unvanquished</b> (1938), <b>The Wild Palms</b> (1939), <b>The Hamlet</b> (1940), and <b>Go Down, Moses</b> (1942)&#x2014;and continued to publish stories regularly in magazines, he was unable to support himself solely by writing fiction. he worked as a screenwriter for MGM, Twentieth Century-Fox, and Warner Brothers, forming a close relationship with director Howard Hawks, with whom he worked on <b>To Have and Have Not</b>, <b>The Big Sleep</b>, and <b>Land of the Pharaohs</b>, among other films. In 1944 all but one of Faulkner's novels were out of print, and his personal life was at low ebb due in part to his chronic heavy drinking. During the war he had been discovered by Sartre and Camus and others in the French literary world. In the postwar period his reputation rebounded, as Malcolm Cowley's anthology <b>The Portable Faulkner</b> brought him fresh attention in America, and the immense esteem in which he was held in Europe consolidated his worldwide stature.<br><br>Faulkner wrote seventeen books set in the mythical Yoknapatawpha County, home of the Compson family in <b>The Sound and the Fury</b>. &#x201c;No land in all fiction lives more vividly in its physical presence than this county of Faulkner&#x2019;s imagination,&#x201d; Robert Penn Warren wrote in an essay on Cowley&#x2019;s anthology. &#x201c;The descendants of the old families, the descendants of bushwhackers and carpetbaggers, the swamp rats, the Negro cooks and farm hands, the bootleggers and gangsters, tenant farmers, college boys, county-seat lawyers, country storekeepers, peddlers&#x2014;all are here in their fullness of life and their complicated interrelations.&#x201d; In 1950, Faulkner traveled to Sweden to accept the 1949 Nobel Prize for Literature. In later books&#x2014;<b>Intruder in the Dust</b> (1948), <b>Requiem for a Nun</b> (1951), <b>A Fable</b> (1954), <b>The Town</b> (1957), <b>The Mansion</b> (1959), and <b>The Reivers</b> (1962)&#x2014;he continued to explore what he had called &#x201c;the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself,&#x201d; but did so in the context of Yoknapatawpha&#x2019;s increasing connection with the modern world. He died of a heart attack on July 6, 1962.Mink<br><br>1<br><br>The jury said "Guilty" and the Judge said "Life" but he didn't hear them. He wasn't listening. In fact, he hadn't been able to listen since that first day when the Judge banged his little wooden hammer on the high desk until he, Mink, dragged his gaze back from the far door of the courtroom to see what in the world the man wanted, and he, the Judge, leaned down across the desk hollering: "You, Snopes! Did you or didn't you kill Zack Houston?" and he, Mink, said, "Dont bother me now. Cant you see I'm busy?" then turned his own head to look again toward the distant door at the back of the room, himself hollering into, against, across the wall of little wan faces hemming him in: "Snopes! Flem Snopes! Anybody here that'll go and bring Flem Snopes! I'll pay you-Flem'll pay you!"<br><br>Because he hadn't had time to listen. In fact, that whole first trip, handcuffed to the deputy, from his jail cell to the courtroom, had been a senseless, a really outrageously foolish interference with and interruption, and each subsequent daily manacled trip and transference, of the solution to both their problems-his and the damned law's both-if they had only waited and let him alone: the watching, his dirty hands gripping among the grimed interstices of the barred window above the street, which had been his one, his imperious need during the entire two months between his incarceration and the opening of the Court.<br><br>At first, during the first few days behind the barred window, he had simply been impatient with his own impatience and-yes, he admitted it- his own stupidity. Long before the moment came when he had had to aim the gun and fire the shot, he knew that his cousin Flem, the only member of his clan with the power to and the reason to, or at least to be expected to, extricate him from its consequences, would not be there to do it. He even knew why Flem would not be there for at least a year; Frenchman's Bend was too small: everybody in it knew everything about everybody else; they would all have seen through that Texas trip even without the hurrah and hullabaloo that Varner girl had been causing ever since she (or whoever else it was) found the first hair on her bump, not to mention just this last past spring and summer while that durn McCarron boy was snuffing and fighting everybody else off exactly like a gang of rutting dogs.<br><br>So that long before Flem married her, he, Mink, and everybody else in ten miles of the Bend knew that old Will Varner was going to have to marry her off to somebody, and that quick, if he didn't want a woods- colt in his back yard next grass. And when it was Flem that finally married her, he, Mink, anyway was not surprised. It was Flem, with his usual luck. All right, more than just luck then: the only man in Frenchman's Bend that ever stood up to and held his own with old Will Varner; that had done already more or less eliminated Jody, old Will's only son, out of the store, and now was fixing to get hold of half of all the rest of it by being old Will's only son-in-law. That just by marrying her in time to save her from dropping a bastard, Flem would not only be the rightful husband of that damn girl that had kept every man under eighty years old in Frenchman's Bend in an uproar ever since she was fifteen years old by just watching her walk past, but he had got paid for it to boot: not only the right to fumble his hand every time the notion struck him under that dress that rutted a man just thinking even about somebody else's hand doing it, but was getting a free deed to that whole Old Frenchman place for doing it.<br><br>So he knew Flem would not be there when he would need him, since he knew that Flem and his new wife would have to stay away from Frenchman's Bend at least long enough for what they would bring back with them to be able to call itself only twelve months old without everybody that looked at it dying of laughing. Only, when the moment finally came, when the instant finally happened when he could no longer defer having to aim the gun and pull the trigger, he had forgot that. No, that was a lie. He hadn't forgot it. He simply could wait no longer: Houston himself would not let him wait longer-and that too was one more injury which Zack Houston in the very act of dying, had done him: compelled him, Mink, to kill him at a time when the only person who had the power to save him and would have had to save him whether he wanted to or not because of the ancient immutable laws of simple blood kinship, was a thousand miles away; and this time it was an irreparable injury because in the very act of committing it, Houston had escaped forever all retribution for it.<br><br>He had not forgotten that his cousin would not be there. He simply couldn't wait any longer. He had simply had to trust them-the Them of whom it was promised that not even a sparrow should fall unmarked. By them he didn't mean that whatever-it-was that folks referred to as Old Moster. He didn't believe in any Old Moster. He had seen too much in his time that, if any Old Moster existed, with eyes as sharp and power as strong as was claimed He had, He would have done something about. Besides, he, Mink, wasn't religious. He hadn't been to a church since he was fifteen years old and never aimed to go again-places which a man with a hole in his gut and a rut in his britches that he couldn't satisfy at home, used, by calling himself a preacher of God, to get conveniently together the biggest possible number of women that he could tempt with the reward of the one in return for the job of the other-the job of filling his hole in payment for getting theirs plugged the first time the husband went to the field and she could slip off to the bushes where the preacher was waiting; the wives coming because here was the best market they knowed of to swap a mess of fried chicken or a sweet potato pie; the husbands coming not to interrupt the trading because he knowed he couldn't interrupt it or even keep up with it, but at least to try and find out if his wife's name would come to the head of the waiting list today or if maybe he could still finish scratching that last forty before he would have to tie her to the bedpost and hide behind the door watching; and the young folks not even bothering to enter the church a-tall for already running to be the first couple behind the nearest handy thicket-bush.<br><br>He meant, simply, that them-they-it, whichever and whatever you wanted to call it, who represented a simple fundamental justice and equity in human affairs, or else a man might just as well quit; the they, them, it, call them what you like, which simply would not, could not harass and harry a man forever without someday, at some moment, letting him get his own just and equal licks back in return. They could harass and worry him, or They could even just sit back and watch everything go against him right along without missing a lick, almost like there was a pattern to it; just sit back and watch and-all right, why not? he-a man-didn't mind, as long as he was a man and there was a justice to it- enjoy it too; maybe in fact They were even testing him, to see if he was a man or not, man enough to take a little harassment and worry and so deserve his own licks back when his turn came. But at least that moment would come when it was his turn, when he had earned the right to have his own just and equal licks back, just as They had earned the right to test him and even to enjoy the testing; the moment when They would have to prove to him that They were as much a man as he had proved to Them that he was; when he not only would have to depend on Them but had won the right to depend on Them and find Them faithful; and They dared not, They would not dare, to let him down, else it would be as hard for Them to live with themselves afterward as it had finally become for him to live with himself and still keep on taking what he had taken from Zack Houston.<br><br>So he knew that morning that Flem was not going to be there. It was simply that he could wait no longer; the moment had simply come when he and Zack Houston could, must, no longer breathe the same air. And so, lacking his cousin's presence, he must fall back on that right to depend on them which he had earned by never before in his life demanding anything of them.<br><br>It began in the spring. No, it began in the fall before. No, it began a long time before that even. It began at the very instant Houston was born already shaped for arrogance and intolerance and pride. Not at the moment when the two of them, he, Mink Snopes also, began to breathe the same north Mississippi air, because he, Mink, was not a contentious man. He had never been. It was simply that his own bad luck had all his life continually harassed and harried him into the constant and unflagging necessity of defending his own simple rights.<br><br>Though it was not until the summer before that first fall that Houston's destiny had actually and finally impinged on his, Mink's, own fate-which was another facet of the outrage: that nothing, not even they, least of all they, had vouchsafed him any warning of what that first encounter would end in. This was the year after Houston's young wife had gone into the stallion's stall hunting a hen-nest and the horse had killed her and any decent man would have thought that any decent husband would have destroyed the horse as fast as he could have run to the house and got his pistol. But not Houston. Houston was not only rich enough to own a blooded stallion capable of killing his wife, but arrogant and intolerant enough to defy all decency afterward and keep the horse: supposed to be so grieving over his wife that even the neighbors didn't dare knock on his front door anymore, yet two or three times a week ripping up and down the road on that next murderer of a horse, with that big Bluetick hound running like a greyhound or another horse along beside it, right up to Varner's store and not even getting down: the three of them just waiting there in the road-the arrogant intolerant man and the bad-eyed horse and the dog that bared its teeth and raised its hackles any time anybody went near it-while H...</p><h2>Palestinian Identity: The Construction of Modern National Consciousness</h2><p>This foundational text now features a new introduction by Rashid Khalidi reflecting on the significance of his work over the past decade and its relationship to the struggle for Palestinian nationhood. Khalidi also casts an eye to the future, noting the strength of Palestinian identity and social solidarity yet wondering whether current trends will lead to Palestinian statehood and independence.</p><p>Rashid Khalidi is Edward Said Professor of Arab Studies at Columbia University. He is also the author of <i>Under Siege: P. L.O. Decisionmaking During the 1982 War</i>, <i>The Iron Cage: The Story of the Palestinian Struggle for Statehood</i>, and <i>Sowing Crisis: The Cold War and American Dominance in the Middle East</i>, and coeditor of <i>The Origins of Arab Nationalism</i>.<p>"I believe that discussions of whether a one-state or a two-state solution to this conflict is preferable have a slightly surreal quality in the current critical environment. What has to be done is not to debate how many states can dance on the head of a pin, but rather to devise how to reverseï¿½very rapidlyï¿½the powerful current dynamic and get the Palestinian people out of the state they are in. The highly inequitable de facto one-state 'solution' now in effect looks more and more entrenched, but, paradoxically, I predict it will become more and more untenable and more violently unstable as time goes on."-From the new introduction</p></p><h2>Interior Design</h2><p>For one/two-semester introductory courses in Interior Design A comprehensive, applications-oriented introduction to the evolving field of interior design, with a focus on the challenges facing designers in the 21st century. Emphasizing good solutions to real problems by examining best practices from the past and present, the author details case studies using a broad range of projects from modest home and work-place designs, to public areas, to full professional involvement in large commercial spaces.</p><p>&#34;Equally valuable as a resource for professionals and amateurs.&#34; -Library Journal<p> Interior design touches the lives of all of us in a very direct way. We all live in interiors, and most of us work, study, shop, and travel inside buildings, vehicles, and other enclosures. At one time or another, almost everyone has been an interior designer on a limited scale, when choosing a paint color or a rug, when buying furniture, or when arranging furniture in a new living place. For these reasons, interior design is&#x2014;or should be&#x2014;of interest to everyone. </p> <p> This book is concerned with the full range of interior design challenges, from the modest and everyday experiences at home and at work to full professional involvement in large projects. It is not a substitute for the level of professional training offered in design schools, for no one book of reasonable size can deal with every aspect of interior design at a level that will support professional practice. It is, rather, a survey of the field of interior design as it now exists. </p> <p> Thus, students embarking on a career in interior design will find in this book a comprehensive introduction to professional study. Readers interested in organizing residential interiors will find the basic information that they may need. This book will also provide a useful guide to those who will be choosing a designer or dealing with professionals in the field from time to time. </p> <p> Interior design is a complex and constantly changing field that has extensive overlap with related professions&#x2014;architecture in particular. Almost from its beginnings, the field of interior design has faced a division between a focus on historicism through the decorative reproduction of historical styles in interiors that most often were residential and an architectural orientation allied to the early twentieth-century movement known as Modernism that was more concerned with larger projects, such as offices, hotels, restaurants, and public buildings. This polarization into two conflicting approaches to interior design has now become obsolete. </p> <p> Contemporary architecture has developed an interest in historicism, not in terms of imitation, but with a willingness to learn from the past and incorporate historical reference into contemporary design. Meanwhile, the general public has moved toward an awareness and acceptance of modern design even in residential spaces, which for many was a last holdout against anything contemporary. These changes in attitude have given rise to a new design vocabulary, less concerned with decoration in formal historic styles and more focused on developing good solutions to the real problems of modern environmental circumstances. At the same time, designers are increasingly interested in seeking help from other specialized fields, such as sociology, economics, and psychology, in an effort to bring creative artistic expression and practical service into a stronger unity. </p> <p> In this book there is no intention to take sides in a nonproductive conflict of views. Rather, the intent is to introduce the reader to the best of past and present thinking, the best practices of both residential and professional design, and to provide a starting point for further reading, study, studio work, and practice. </p> <p> This third edition of <i>Interior Deign</i> has been extensively revised in text and illustrations to take account of design issues that have become of particular concern in the first decade of the twenty-first century. These issues, although touched on in previous editions, have now assumed greater importance to every designer, making it necessary to promote them to major themes in this edition. Three themes stand out as dominant new concerns. </p> <p> The first of these themes is social and environmental responsibility. In addition to concern for the needs and wishes of individual people, this edition reflects a growing concern for work that moves beyond the desire to please a client or generate a strong visual impact and toward increasing focus on consideration of social and environmental responsibility. Designers and often their clients are now aware of the impact of designed environments on the sustainability of the natural resources they consume and of other ways in which they themselves influence the world in which they exist. The choice of materials, products, and systems with awareness of these issues is known as <i>green deign,</i> and it can generate work as aesthetically satisfying as any earlier work. Many projects and materials illustrated here demonstrate this. The influence of the ideas of green design can be felt in almost every chapter. </p> <p> The second theme taking on new importance is the role of digital technology in the practice of interior design and in realized interior projects. Although most designers continue to value the hand skills associated with T square, triangle, and pencil, the computer and the techniques associated with its use are now essential elements of professional practice in even the smallest design firms. Use of the computer as a tool for drafting and perspective drawing has come into wide acceptance, while its value in researching, estimating, specifying and ordering, communicating, and marketing is now generally recognized as well. Early fears that individual creativity would in some way be reduced by electronic intervention have now largely given way to an understanding of how computers, intelligently used, can simplify and expedite design work, ultimately contributing to superior results. Spatial forms that were difficult or impossible to achieve are now in use thanks to computer capabilities, as many new illustrations suggest. Also, the entrance of computer technology into many residential and commercial spaces as a utility that must be designed for and as a tool for the control of a building's mechanical systems (lighting, heat, and air-conditioning) has called for new documentation in this edition. </p> <p> The third major theme of this edition is the increasing professionalization of the interior design field. Licensing laws and qualifying examinations are based on the growing realization that interior design is a serious matter with impact on the health, safety, and general well-being of the larger population that lives and works almost entirely within interior spaces. The responsibility that designers may have felt toward their clients and the larger public as a matter of conscience is now mandated by standards and codes having a legal basis. Specifics of such formal requirements are a significant part of this book. The increasing professionalism of the field has brought it into closer accord with the related design professions. Architects who were, in the past, often at odds with "mere decorators" are increasingly active as participants in the interior design field. At the same time, designers with recognized status as professionals find acceptance in cooperation with architects, often working within architectural organizations. </p> <p> The role of the amateur designer also survives, growing and prospering as those who design their own living space (perhaps with the aid of books such as this) approach the competence of professionals. The transition from amateur to professional, long a common route into design, is by no means closed, but the field now , demands much more than a sense of style. </p> <p> Since the appearance of the second edition, newly active designers and design firms have become known and have produced outstanding work. Many new illustrations and a number of new case studies document these developments. Older, well-established designers and firms continue to produce work that often incorporates fresh ideas. New illustrations make such current practice visible. </p> <p> The history chapter now includes expanded emphasis on non-Western traditions, and new technical developments, particularly in the field of lighting, are reviewed. An expanded and updated bibliography with a list of useful websites provides access for further research into every aspect of the interior design field, while an enlarged glossary makes it easier to check the meaning of technical terms of the field. In almost every chapter the concerns discussed above&#x2014;those of social and environmental responsibility, the expanding role of computer technology, and the increasing professionalism of the field&#x2014;are subjects of expanded concern and discussion. </p> <p> The interior designer of the twenty-first century, whether amateur or professional, faces a broadening and deepening sense of responsibility to the complex demands of the modern world. The field is more difficult now than it was in past years, but, as compensation, it is now more interesting than ever, offering greater service to its ultimate audience, the users of designed interior space. It is hoped that this book will constitute for the reader only the beginning of the learning process and that it will be supplemented by the identification, observation, and study of good work, which is the most significant form of education in any design field. </p> <p> <b>JOHN F.

One of the boys hits a foul ball that kills the other boy's mother. The boy who hits the ball doesn't believe in accidents; Owen Meany believes he is God's instrument. What happens to Owen after that 1953 foul ball is extraordinary.</p><p></p></p><p>Owen Meany is a dwarfish boy with a strange voice who accidentally kills his best friend's mom with a baseball and believes--accurately--that he is an instrument of God, to be redeemed by martyrdom. John Irving's novel, which inspired the 1998 Jim Carrey movie <i>Simon Birch</i>, is his most popular book in Britain, and perhaps the oddest Christian mystic novel since Flannery O'Connor's work. Irving fans will find much that is familiar: the New England prep-school-town setting, symbolic amputations of man and beast, the Garp-like unknown father of the narrator (Owen's orphaned best friend), the rough comedy. The scene of doltish the doltish headmaster driving a trashed VW down the school's marble staircase is a marvelous set piece. So are the Christmas pageants Owen stars in. But it's all, as <i>Highlights</i> magazine used to put it, "fun with a purpose." When Owen plays baby Jesus in the pageants, and glimpses a tombstone with his death date while enacting <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, the slapstick doesn't cancel the fact that he <i>was</i> born to be martyred. The book's countless subplots add up to a moral argument, specifically an indictment of American foreign policy--from Vietnam to the Contras. <p> The book's mystic religiosity is steeped in Robertson Davies's Deptford trilogy, and the fatal baseball relates to the fatefully misdirected snowball in the first Deptford novel, <i>Fifth Business</i>. Tiny, symbolic Owen echoes the hero of Irving's teacher Gï¿½nter Grass's <i>The Tin Drum</i>--the two characters share the same initials. A rollicking entertainment, <i>Owen Meany</i> is also a meditation on literature, history, and God. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>I have been a voracious reader since childhood, and while I've read and loved many, many books, I can honestly say that A Prayer for Owen Meany is my all-time favorite! It is such an extraordinarily funny, moving and heartbreaking story and then ending is the best and most satisfying one I've ever read. The highlight of my first year working for Ballantine Books was attending a reading John Irving gave for the paperback publication. Owen Meany has a very memorable voice when you read the book, so you can imagine how exciting it was for me to hear my favorite author read my favorite book and DO THE VOICE OF OWEN MEANY!<br><br>M. Coolman<br>Ballantine Publicity</p><h2>The Tudor Constitution: Documents and Commentary</h2><p>Though the first edition of this book (1960) rapidly established itself as a sound collection of source material and a comprehensive analysis of the government of England in the sixteenth century, the astonishing amount of work done, by many hands including the author&#39;s, in the last twenty years has rendered a revision very necessary. The scope of these changes is indicated by the fact that in the list of books cited some 180 make a first appearance while some 70 have been discarded. In the upshot, no single section has remained unaltered and several (especially on the Church, on Parliament and on the Law) have had to be entirely rewritten. While there was room for the addition of only a few documents, they have been chosen with an eye to topics especially alive in the researches of the present day.

Saturday, 28 December 1598, the forty-first year of the reign of Elizabeth Tudor, Queen of England and Ireland. On the edge of London Town, in the precinct of Holywell, workmen gather in the yard before the old Theatre, snow on their beards, stamping their boots and clapping their gloved hands to keep warm. Hailing each other with ale-warmed breath: work to do, and that quickly, shillings to earn even in holiday time. Wood was scarce in London, the forests that ringed the city stripped bare. The workmen had been hired to tear down the Theatre, the first of its kind, and move the salvaged framing to master carpenter Peter Street&#x2019;s Thames-side warehouse, hard by Bridewell Stairs. Steal a whole building, someone winked, right out from under the absent landlord&#x2019;s nose, though who rightly owned the Theatre would need years of litigation to decide.1 The Burbage brothers, William Shakespeare&#x2019;s partners in the theater business, believed they did. They&#x2019;d built it, in 1576. Let the landlord keep his land. They would dismantle their playhouse and raise it elsewhere.<br> <br>Giles Allen, the landlord, away at his country house in Essex, would tell the court that men with weapons bullied aside the servants he sent with a power of attorney to stop them. With all the shouting, a crowd gathered. The Burbage brothers were there that day. So was Shakespeare. Moving the playhouse was urgent if their acting company would have a stage to perform on. Allen was threatening to pull it down himself and salvage the timbers to build tenements, as apartments were called in Shakespeare&#x2019;s day.<br> <br>The Burbages&#x2019; workmen dismantled the wooden building and carted the framing away. Two days earlier, the company had played before the Queen at Whitehall Palace. It was scheduled to play there again on New Year&#x2019;s night. The Theatre came down between the two performances.<br> <br>It went up again in Spring 1599 across the Thames in bawdy Southwark, enlarged and renamed the Globe, a twenty-sided polygon three stories high and a hundred feet across, with a thatched ring of roof open to the sky above a wide yard. Peter Street probably cut the new timber for the enlargement in a forest near Windsor, west of London, lopped and topped and barked and shaped it there to avoid the cost of barging whole trees down the Thames. A Swiss tourist, Thomas Platter, attended a production of Julius Caesar in the new Globe on the afternoon of 21 September 1599, so it was up and running by then. He thought the play &#x201c;quite aptly performed.&#x201d;2<br> <br>Elizabethan England was a country built of wood. &#x201c;The greatest part of our building in the cities and good towns of England,&#x201d; the Elizabethan observer William Harrison reported in 1577, &#x201c;consisteth only of timber.&#x201d;3 Even the country&#x2019;s implements, its plows and hoes, were wooden, if iron edged. London was a wooden city, peak-roofed and half-timbered, heating itself with firewood burned on stone hearths called reredos raised in the middle of rooms, the sweet wood smoke drifting through the house and out the windows.<br> <br> <br>A reredos, with hook above for hanging a kettle.<br><br>But wood was growing dear, its price increasing as London&#x2019;s population increased and woodcutters carted firewood into the city from farther and farther afield. Parliament provided a limited remedy in 1581: a law prohibiting the production of charcoal for iron smelting within fourteen miles of London, to reserve the nearby trees for domestic fuel. Even so, the cost of firewood delivered to the city more than doubled between 1500 and 1592, consistent with the burgeoning population, which quadrupled between 1500 and 1600, from 50,000 to 200,000.4 (England&#x2019;s entire population increased across that century from 3.25 million to 4.07 million.5)<br> <br>Some economists today question if England was running out of wood. The Burbages and their company moved the Theatre&#x2019;s framing not only to save wood but also to save time and money putting up their new, enlarged Globe bankside. And wood, after all, is a renewable resource. Yet many seventeenth- and eighteenth-century government officials, parliamentarians, and private observers feared a wood shortage, especially of large oak trees suitable for ships&#x2019; masts.<br> <br>Warships were as valuable to national security in those days as aircraft carriers are today. About 2,500 large oak trees went into an average English ship of the line.6 It was a beautiful wooden fighting machine, massive and solid, fifty feet wide and two hundred feet long. Two rows of cannon mounted on wooden trucks pierced its bulging yellow sides. Its decks were painted dull red to veil the blood that flowed in battle.7 It carried its sails on no fewer than twenty-three masts, yards, and spars, from the forty-yard-long, eighteen-ton mainmast to the little fore topgallant-yard, a light seven-yard stick.8 Patriots said the Royal Navy was England&#x2019;s &#x201c;wooden walls,&#x201d; protecting it from invasion. The Admiralty built and maintained about one hundred ships of the line as well as several hundred smaller ships and boats. Battle and shipworms ravaged them; they needed replacing every decade or two.<br> <br>But the great mast trees took 80 to 120 years to grow to sufficient diameter. A landowner who planted an acorn could hope his grandchildren or great-grandchildren might harvest it for profit&#x2014;if the intervening generations could wait so long. Many could not; many did not. Selling timber was an easy means to raise cash; landowners from the king on down took advantage of the opportunity whenever their purses emptied. Wood, the dilettante second Earl of Carnarvon told a friend of the diarist Samuel Pepys, was &#x201c;an excrescence of the earth provided by God for the payment of debts.&#x201d;9<br> <br>Crooked hedgerow timbers&#x2014;&#x201c;compass timbers,&#x201d; the Admiralty called them&#x2014;were as important to ship construction as the straight forest timbers needed for the masts. These great bent oaks supplied curved and branched single pieces for the keel, the stern-post, and the ribs of the ship&#x2019;s hull. They were always scarce and priced accordingly, but with the enclosure movement of late-medieval England&#x2014;the privatization and consolidation of communal fields into sheep pasture to benefit the manorial lords&#x2014;most of the compass trees were cut down. Finding the right piece for a ship could take years.<br> <br> <br>The Ark Royal, built for Sir Walter Raleigh in 1587, carried fifty-five guns on two gun decks. In 1588 she chased the Spanish Armada into the North Sea.<br><br>The Royal Navy was not the only enterprise consuming the forests of England. By the 1630s, the country supported some three hundred iron-smelting operations, which burned three hundred thousand loads of wood annually to make charcoal, each load counting as a large tree.10 Building and maintaining the more numerous ships of British commerce required three times as much oak as did navy shipping.<br> <br>Timber, oak in particular, competed with grain for arable land. Great trees needed deep, rich soil, but it was more profitable to farm such land for feed. A Suffolk County official named Thomas Preston associated mighty forests with primitive conditions, &#x201c;the past age&#x201d; when the kingdom possessed &#x201c;a great plenty of oak.&#x201d; The diminution of oak measured the kingdom&#x2019;s improvement, he argued, &#x201c;a thousand times more valuable than any timber can ever be.&#x201d; Preston hoped the diminution would continue: &#x201c;While we are forced to feed our people with foreign wheat, and our horses with foreign oats, can raising oak be an object? . . . The scarcity of timber ought never to be regretted, for it is a certain proof of national improvement; and for Royal navies, countries yet barbarous are the right and only proper nurseries.&#x201d;11<br> <br>Those barbarous countries included North America, especially New England, where the colonists had just begun to harvest the primeval forest. There, from 1650 onward, the Admiralty sought the strong &#x201c;single stick&#x201d; masts its warships required, forty yards long and three to four feet in diameter. The colonists competed for the wood, however. The first American sawmill began operations in 1663 on the Salmon Falls River in New Hampshire, long before the English advanced from sawing board by hand to using water power. By 1747, there were 90 such water-powered mills along the Salmon Falls and the Piscataqua, with 130 teams of oxen working hauling logs. Among them, they cut about six million board feet of timber annually for sale in Boston, the West Indies, and beyond. England got her share. The eighteenth-century historian Daniel Neal, in his The History of New-England, noted that the Piscataqua was &#x201c;the principal place of trade for masts of any of the king&#x2019;s dominions.&#x201d;12<br> <br>Unfortunately for the Royal Navy, America&#x2019;s successful revolution three decades later cut off its supply of American white pine. It had to return to its earlier expedient of using &#x201c;made masts&#x201d;: weaker composite masts of multiple trees strapped together around a central spindle.<br> <br>Besides making charcoal to smelt iron, the English cut down timber to build houses, barns, and fences; to produce glass and refine lead; to build bridges, docks, locks, canal boats, and forts; and to make beer and cider barrels. More than one of these uses consumed as much wood as the navy. Even royalty was guilty of misusing the royal forests, while Parliament stood by. &#x201c;The final failure of the woodlands,&#x201d; a historian concludes, &#x201c;was the result of constant neglect and abuse.&#x201d;13<br> <br>The Jacobean agriculturalist Arthur Standish was concerned less with the needs of the Royal Navy and more with what he called &#x201c;the general destruction and waste of wood&#x201d; when he published The Commons Complaint under King James I&#x2019;s endorsement in 1611, but he included &#x201c;timber . . . for navigation&#x201d; among the shortages that he foresaw. Paraphrasing one of the king&#x2019;s speeches before Parliament in his stark summary of the consequences, Standish concluded: &#x201c;And so it may be conceived, no wood, no kingdom.&#x201d;14<br> <br>A cheaper alternative was burning coal&#x2014;sea coal or pit coal, the Elizabethans called it to distinguish it from charcoal. (A coal was originally any burning ember, thus char-coal for charred wood, and sea coal or pit coal for the fossil fuel, depending on whether it outcropped on the headlands above the beaches or was dug from the ground.) Harrison, in his 1577 contribution to the Elizabethan anthology Holinshed&#x2019;s Chronicles, had found the English Midlands already in transition to the fossil fuel: &#x201c;Of coal-mines, we have such plenty in the north and western parts of our island as may suffice for all the realm of England.&#x201d;15 Coal had served blacksmiths for hundreds of years. Soap boilers used it; so did lime burners, who roasted limestone in kilns to make quicklime for plaster; so did salt boilers, who boiled down seawater in open iron pans, a tedious process prodigal of fuel, to make salt for food preservation in the centuries before refrigeration.<br> <br>But the acrid smoke and sulfurous stench of the Midlands&#x2019;s coal had not encouraged its domestic use in houses devoid of chimneys where meat was roasted over open fires. &#x201c;The nice dames of London,&#x201d; as a chronicler called them, were unwilling even to enter such houses. In 1578 Elizabeth I herself objected to the stink of coal smoke blowing into Westminster Palace from a nearby brewery and sent at least one brewer to prison that year for his effrontery.16 A chastened Company of Brewers offered to burn only wood near the palace.<br> <br>Like nuclear power in the twentieth century, but justifiably, coal in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was feared to be toxic, tainted by its origins, diabolic: &#x201c;poisonous when burnt in dwellings,&#x201d; a historian summarizes Elizabethan prejudices, &#x201c;and . . . especially injurious to the human complexion. All sorts of diseases were attributed to its use.&#x201d;17 The black stone found layered underground that burned like the stinking fires of hell&#x2014;the Devil&#x2019;s very excrement, preachers ranted&#x2014;suffered as well from its association with mining, an industry that poets and clergy had long condemned. Geoffrey Chaucer, in his short poem &#x201c;The Former Age,&#x201d; written about 1380, set the tone:<br> <br>But cursed was the time, I dare well say,<br> <br>That men first did their sweaty business<br> <br>To grub up metal, lurking in darkness,<br> <br>And in the rivers first gems sought.<br> <br>Alas! Then sprung up all the cursedness<br> <br>Of greed, that first our sorrow brought!18<br> <br>The German humanist Georgius Agricola, a physician in the mining town of Joachimstal, paraphrased the arguments of mining&#x2019;s detractors in his 1556 work De re Metallica and quoted Ovid condemning mining in similar terms. The Roman poet, he wrote, had portrayed men as ever descending &#x201c;?&#x2018;into the entrails of the earth, [where] they dug up riches, those incentives to vice, which the earth had hidden and had removed to the Stygian shades. Then destructive iron came forth, and gold, more destructive than iron; then war came forth.&#x2019;?&#x201d;19 A century after Agricola, John Milton was still condemning mining, associating it with the fallen angel Mammon in the first book of Paradise Lost:<br> <br>There stood a Hill not far whose grisly top<br> <br>Belched fire and rolling smoke; the rest entire<br> <br>Shone with a glossy scurf, undoubted sign<br> <br>That in his womb was hid metallic ore,<br> <br>The work of sulfur. Thither winged with speed<br> <br>A numerous brigade hastened . . . .<br> <br>Mammon led them on,<br> <br>Mammon, the least erected spirit that fell<br> <br>From Heaven, for even in Heaven his looks and thoughts<br> <br>Were always downward bent, admiring more<br> <br>The riches of Heaven&#x2019;s pavement, trodden gold,<br> <br>Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed<br> <br>In vision beatific: by him first<br> <br>Men also, and by his suggestion taught,<br> <br>Ransacked the center, and with impious hands<br> <br>Rifled the bowels of their mother Earth<br> <br>For treasures better hid.20<br> <br>Impious hands or not, the Elizabethans were short of wood, so they began to dig coal and burn it. To do that without asphyxiating themselves, they needed chimneys to exhaust the smoke. Harrison, the chronicler, says old men in his village noticed the increase in chimneys, &#x201c;whereas in their young days there was not above two or three.&#x201d; For Harrison, the development was doubtful, even hell-in-a-handcart:<br> <br>Now we have many chimneys, and yet our tenderlings complain of rheums, catarrhs, and poses [head colds]; then had we none but reredoses, and our heads did never a...</p><h2>The Great Partition: The Making of India and Pakistan</h2><p><b>A reappraisal of the tumultuous Partition and how it ignited long-standing animosities between India and Pakistan</b><br><br> This new edition of Yasmin Khan&#x2019;s reappraisal of the tumultuous India-Pakistan Partition features an introduction reflecting on the latest research and on ways in which commemoration of the Partition has changed, and considers the Partition in light of the current refugee crisis.<br> &nbsp;<br> Reviews of the first edition:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A riveting book on this terrible story.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Economist</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Unsparing. . . .

This volume uses design patterns to present techniques for implementing effective resource management in a system. <p>The patterns are covered in detail making use of several examples&nbsp;providing directions to the readers on how to implement the presented patterns. Additionally, the volume presents a thorough introduction into resource management and a case study where the patterns are applied to the domain of mobile radio networks.

From embedded software in a mobile device to software in a large enterprise server, it is important that resources, such as memory, threading, files, or network connections, are managed efficiently to allow the systems to function properly and effectively. <p>As the need for resource management is often discovered late in the software development lifecycle, and changing the system design at this late stage is difficult, it is important that such tasks are performed early in the lifecycle. Since systems belonging to different domains have different system constraints and requirements, a technique that works well in a particular system or configuration might not be so effective in another.</p> <p>POSA 3 uses patterns to present techniques for implementing effective resource management in a system. The patterns are covered in detail, making use of several examples, and, as in previous POSA volumes, directions are given on how to implement the presented patterns. Additionally, the volume presents a thorough introduction into resource management, and two case studies where the patterns are applied to the domains of ad hoc networking and mobile radio networks.

Modelled on Brontï¿½&#x2019;s own experiences as a student and teacher in Brussels, <em>Villette</em> is the sombre but engrossing story of Lucy Snowe, an unmarried Englishwoman making her way in a culture deeply foreign to her. The heroine&#x2019;s relationships with the fiery professor M.

First published in 1853, <i>Villette</i> is Bronte's most accomplished and deeply felt work, eclipsing even <i>Jane Eyre</i> in critical acclaim. Her narrator, the autobiographical Lucy Snowe, flees England and a tragic past to become an instructor in a French boarding school in the town of Villette. There, she unexpectedly confronts her feelings of love and longing as she witnesses the fitful romance between Dr. John, a handsome young Englishman, and Ginerva Fanshawe, a beautiful coquetter. This first pain brings others, and with them comes the heartache Lucy has tried so long to escape. Yet in spite of adversity and disappointment, Lucy Snowe survives to recount the unstinting vision of a turbulent life's journey--a journey that is one of the most insightful fictional studies of a woman's consciousness in English literature.<p> <strong>Kate Lawson</strong> is an Associate Professor of English at the University of Waterloo.

Though not readily identified by most Americans, nor indeed by many Mexican Americans, Corona is a man of enormous political commitment whose activism has spanned much of this century. Now his voice can be heard by the wide audience it deserves. In this landmark publication&#x2015;the first autobiography by a major figure in Chicano history&#x2015;Bert Corona relates his life story.<br><br>Corona was born in El Paso in 1918. Inspired by his parents' participation in the Mexican Revolution, he dedicated his life to fighting economic and social injustice. An early labor organizer among ethnic communities in southern California, Corona has agitated for labor and civil rights since the 1940s. His efforts continue today in campaigns to organize undocumented immigrants.<br><br>This book evolved from a three-year oral history project between Bert Corona and historian Mario T. Garcï¿½a. The result is a <i>testimonio</i>, a collaborative autobiography in which historical memories are preserved more through oral traditions than through written documents. Corona's story represents a collective memory of the Mexican-American community's struggle against discrimination and racism. His narration and Garcï¿½a's analysis together provide a journey into the Mexican-American world.<br><br>Bert Corona's reflections offer us an invaluable glimpse at the lifework of a major grass-roots American leader. His story is further enriched by biographical sketches of others whose names have been little recorded during six decades of American labor history.</p><p><b>Mario T. Garcï¿½a</b> is Professor of History and Chicano Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He is the author of <i>Mexican Americans: Leadership, Ideology, and Identity, 1930-1960</i> (1989). <b>David Montgomery</b> is Professor of History at Yale University.The narrative of Corona's work as a Mexican American labor organizer reflects some five decades of struggles, setbacks, and successes. Beginning with the union movement of the 1930s, Corona traces his experience in organizing workers and communities as they confronted large corporate interests backed by the government agenices that served them. The uphill battle to win economic and political recognition is recounted in a straightforward manner, free of rancor. Indeed, Corona's model for success is founded on cooperation, ethnic pride of accomplishment, and optimistic determination. As an oral history conducted by Garcia (the result is billed as a collaborative autobiography), the story conveys a sense of the "collective self"--a testimonial of one member of a community.

This classic of urban anthropology, one of the most acclaimed ethnographies of recent years, offers vivid, literary descriptions of Fontana del Re, an impoverished Neapolitan neighborhood. Belmonte documents the struggles of Neapolitans surrounded by crumbling buildings and economic insecurity. He details family dynamics as well as the working of Naples's informal economy, the day-to-day struggle for economic subsistence, and the intermittent begging and thieving of the young. Taking us from the bustling, vibrant, and gritty streets and alleyways of Naples to the kitchen tables of poor Neapolitan homes, Belmonte resists simplistic depictions of the poor. Instead, he presents subtle, compelling portraits and analyses that capture the emotional, social, and economic lives of his subjects.<br><br>In addition to the continuing relevance of his insights into the effects of poverty, Belmonte's willingness to reflect on his own reactions and emotions while in the field has influenced a generation of scholars. In <i>The Broken Fountain</i>, he poignantly describes the experience of living alone in a strange urban environment and his interactions with the residents of Fontana del Re.<br><br>This edition includes a foreword by Ida Susser and an afterword by Pellegrino D'Acierno and Stanislao G.

What are the differences among the sample distribution, the sampling distribution, and the population distribution? In an experiment, what effect does the sampling method have on the results? What are the implications of the use of processes of random selection and random assignment? Can a small sample yield accurate estimates of population parameters?<br><br>This book examines five big ideas and twenty-four related essential understandings for teaching statistics in grades 9-12. The authors distinguish mathematical and statistical models, explore distributions as descriptions of variability in data, focus on the fundamentals of testing hypotheses to draw conclusions from data, highlight the importance of the data collection method, and recognize the need to examine bias, precision, and sampling method in evaluating statistical estimators. Recognizing that analyzing data is an important part of understanding the world, the authors discuss the growth of students ideas about statistics and examine challenges to teaching, learning, and assessment.

The authors demonstrate how the FBI's covert counter-intelligence program known as COINTELPRO, which was set up to undermine liberal groups, came to symbolize the whole context of "clandestine political repression activities."

Over the past decades, he has created a large body of critically acclaimed fiction (A Clockwork Orange, Earthly Powers, etc.), criticism (The Novel Now, Joysprick and book-length nonfiction (Language Made Plain, etc.) that have made him one of the most respected writers in the English language. At the same time, as this 600-page collection attests, he has been producing reams of high-quality journalism covering travel, food, music, people, film, astrology, language and, above all, literature. This collection of his short pieces from the last seven years, mostly book reviews, displays an impressive diversity and acuity. Burgess is a master reviewer: pithy, polymathic without pedantry, quick to find a virtue or fault, often witty and always, at bottom, generous. Many of the pieces ("Grunts from a Sexist Pig," "Yidglish," "What Shakespeare Smelt," etc.) are well-known favorites. Less familiar are his interesting considerations of such half-forgotten figures as George Borrow, G. K. Chesterton and Ford Madox Ford. His evaluation of the Frenchtoo much Descartes in their bloodstream, not enough Rabelaisprovokes and amuses. Also included are perceptive essays on American contemporaries such as Noam Chomsky, Gore Vidal and Norman Mailer. This wide-ranging collection is incredibly rich. 25,000 first printing; 25,000 ad/promo. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.In nearly 200 reviews and essays written for the Times Literary Supplement , the Observer , and the New York Times , Burgess thrusts his canny, sensitive mind into regions as diverse as fashion, film, musical theater, structural linguistics, religion, literature, music, travel, and feminism. While evenhanded on the strengths and weaknesses of John Updike and Norman Mailer, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Leonard Bernstein, he is occasionally uncompromising: Joyce is the great novelist of the century, Ford the best English novelist, Pound the best poet. He is most elegantly provocative when polymathic perversegracious to Sophia Loren, Grace Kelly, and Yves St. Laurent, brutal to feminists, those he finds culturally arrogant (the French and certain academics), and the culturally deprived (the younger generation). Burgess's field of intellectual energy is supercharged, and enlightenment bolts in all directions. Recommended.

Such prizes and the competitions they crown are almost as old as the arts themselves, but their number and power--and their consequences for society and culture at large--have expanded to an unprecedented degree in our day. In a wide-ranging overview of this phenomenon, James F. English documents the dramatic rise of the awards industry and its complex role within what he describes as an economy of cultural prestige.</p><p>Observing that cultural prizes in their modern form originate at the turn of the twentieth century with the institutional convergence of art and competitive spectator sports, English argues that they have in recent decades undergone an important shift--a more genuine and far-reaching globalization than what has occurred in the economy of material goods. Focusing on the cultural prize in its contemporary form, his book addresses itself broadly to the economic dimensions of culture, to the rules or logic of exchange in the market for what has come to be called "cultural capital." In the wild proliferation of prizes, English finds a key to transformations in the cultural field as a whole. And in the specific workings of prizes, their elaborate mechanics of nomination and election, presentation and acceptance, sponsorship, publicity, and scandal, he uncovers evidence of the new arrangements and relationships that have refigured that field.</p></p><p>James F.

But for a woman of the twelfth century her achievements were so exceptional that posterity has found it hard to take her measure. Barbara Newman, a premier Hildegard authority, brings major scholars together to present an accurate portrait of the Benedictine nun and her many contributions to twelfth-century religious, cultural, and intellectual life. Written by specialists in fields ranging from medieval theology to medicine to music, these essays offer an understanding of how one woman could transform so many of the traditions of the world in which she lived.<br><br>Hildegard of Bingen was the only woman of her age accepted as an authoritative voice on Christian doctrine as well as the first woman permitted by the pope to write theological books. She was the author of the first known morality play; an artist of unusual talents; the most prolific chant composer of her era; and the first woman to write extensively on natural science and medicine, including sexuality as seen from a female perspective. She was the only woman of her time to preach openly to mixed audiences of clergy and laity, and the first saint whose biography includes a first-person memoir.<br><br>Adding to the significance of this volume is the fact that Hildegard's oeuvre reflects the entire sweep of twelfth-century culture and society. Scholars and lay readers alike will find this collection a rich introduction to a remarkable figure and to her tumultuous world. With the commemoration of the 900th anniversary of Hildegard's birth in September 1998, the publication of <i>Voice of the Living Light</i> is especially welcome.</p><p>&#34;This is a well-crafted and keenly focused overview of Saint Hildegard&#39;s life and thought. The contributors adhere to the highest standards of scholarship, write with engagement and clarity, offer new insights, provide a good sense of earlier interpretations, and furnish both provocative insights and excellent clues for further exploration into the subject. This truly is a superior work.&#34;-Grover Zinn, Oberlin College<b>Barbara Newman</b> is Professor of English and Religion at Northwestern University.

But how do you know? What factors add up to success-or failure-in a relationship? Author Jeffry Larson knows; in fact, he knows a lot about what predicts a happy marriage. Based on Larson&#39;s twenty-plus years of research and experience in marriage and family therapy, Should We Stay Together? debunks many time-honored myths as it provides couples with the tools they need to make better decisions and thoroughly explore every aspect of their relationship. From individual characteristics, idiosyncratic family histories, unresolved conflicts and needs, and combined strengths and weaknesses, this step-by-step scientific method for relationship evaluation-based on the highly accurate RELATE premarital assessment questionnaire-will help couples understand the specific traits that predict a satisfying-or disastrous-relationship.</p><p>Falling in love is the easy part; finding a truly compatible mate takes know-how. Drawing from a 10-year study of premarital characteristics that predict later marital satisfaction, author Jeffry H. Larson presents an excellent resource for couples considering marriage. Opening chapters debunk the many myths associated with happy relationships, everything from searching for soul mates to obeying the whims of the heart. Larson points to three key factors that affect all partnerships: contexts (each person's background), individual traits, and couple traits; he then shows how similarities and differences in each category lead to success or failure in marriage. By far the most intriguing aspect of this combination textbook and workbook is its series of checklists, discussion questions, and short tests designed for assessing one's relationship. Working alone or with their partners, readers can rather quickly determine the potential long-term satisfaction of their current relationships, based on the 24 key characteristics outlined in Larson's Relationship Evaluation (RELATE) questionnaire. Brief questions regarding similarity of values, communication skills, and conflict response patterns receive points that correspond to an evaluation scale. Larson concludes each exercise with plenty of clear, descriptive support material so participants can better interpret their test scores. For those who uncover a few bumps in their RELATE triangle, a final chapter offers an abundance of self-help and couples' therapy books, tapes, and workshops. <i>--Liane Thomas</i>[head] Will we live happily ever after? <p>The fact is, some couples need more time to mature, some need to work through specific issues, and some should never be together.

Those who know Lï¿½vi-Strauss and <i>Tristes Tropiques</i> by reputation only will be pleasantly surprised by the intimate tone that colors even its most precise anthropological sections, as well as the autobiographical passages at the beginning, in which the author recounts how he fell into his career and how, shortly after the Nazis occupied Paris, he was forced to flee to America in a grueling sea voyage. Twenty-five black-and-white photographs of tribespeople, as well as numerous line drawings, accompany the text.Tristes Tropiques is one of the great books of our century," said Susan Sontag. "It is rigorous, subtle, and bold in thought. It is beauti-<br>fully written.

Claude Lï¿½vi-Strauss's ground-<br>breaking study of the societies of a number of Amazonian peoples is a cornerstone of structural anthropology and an exploration by the author of his own intellectual roots as a professor of philosophy in Brazil before the Second World War, as a Jewish exile from Nazi-occupied Europe, and later as a world-renowned academic (he taught at New York's New School for Social Research and was French cultural attachï¿½ to the United States). Lï¿½vi-Strauss's central journey leads from the Amazon basin through the dense upland jungles of Brazil. There, among the Amerindian tribes--the Caduveo, Bororo, Nambikwara, and Tupi-Kawahib--he found "a human society reduced to its most basic expression." Lï¿½vi-Strauss's discussion of his fieldwork in Tristes Tropiques endures as a milestone of anthropology, but the book is also, in its brilliant diversions on other, more familiar cultures, a great work of literature, a vivid travelogue, and an engaging memoir--a demonstration of the marvelous mental agility of one of the century<br>'s most important thinkers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presented here is the translation by John and Doreen Weightman of the complete text of the revised French edition of 1968, together with the original photographs and illustrations. <br><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of liter-ature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inaugurat-<br>ing a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.</p><h2>M: Information Systems</h2><p><b>Baltzan; M: Information Systems</b> is a visual, magazine format designed to engage your students from the start! Saturated with fascinating, sometimes hard-to-believe real examples will keep them reading throughout the course. Baltzan&#x2019;s approach discusses various business initiatives <i>first</i> and how technology supports those initiatives second. The premise for this unique approach is that business initiatives drive technology choices in a corporation. Therefore, every discussion addresses the business needs first and addresses the technology that supports those needs second. This approach takes the difficult and often intangible MIS concepts, brings them down to the student&#x2019;s level, and applies them using a hands-on approach to reinforce the concepts.

Until now. Here the latest of Derek Hayes&#x2019;s historical atlases delves into the history of the railroad in North America, from its origins in Britain in the 1820s and short lines connecting Eastern Seaboard rivers in the 1830s to Amtrak and the modern intermodal freights driving today&#x2019;s railroad revival. Colorful and informative, the book covers a vast range of topics and offers an impressive array of types of railroad map, from the purely utilitarian to the gorgeously promotional. Nearly 400 old railroad maps, most in full color, plus many historical photos, brochures, and posters, combine to provide a new perspective on the North American railroad. <i>Historical Atlas of the North American Railroad</i> also explains how the railroad transformed the economic and social life of a continent, fundamentally changing the two North American nations it linked from the Atlantic to the Pacific.<br><br></p><p>&#x201c;Makes such a valuable contribution to United States and Canadian history generally, and railroad history specifically, that I found it hard to put down.&#x201d; --Carlos A. Schwantes, author of <i>Just One Restless Rider: Reflections on Trains and Travel</i> and <i>The Pacific Northwest: An Interpretive History (Revised and Enlarged Edition)</i><b>Derek Hayes</b> is the author of many books, including <i>Historical Atlas of the United States, Historical Atlas of California,</i> and <i>Historical Atlas of the American West</i>, all from UC Press.</p><h2>Introduction to Classical Real Analysis</h2><p>This classic book is a text for a standard introductory course in real analysis, covering sequences and series, limits and continuity, differentiation, elementary transcendental functions, integration, infinite series and products, and trigonometric series. The author has scrupulously avoided any presumption at all that the reader has any knowledge of mathematical concepts until they are formally presented in the book. One significant way in which this book differs from other texts at this level is that the integral which is first mentioned is the Lebesgue integral on the real line. There are at least three good reasons for doing this. First, this approach is no more difficult to understand than is the traditional theory of the Riemann integral. Second, the readers will profit from acquiring a thorough understanding of Lebesgue integration on Euclidean spaces before they enter into a study of abstract measure theory. Third, this is the integral that is most useful to current applied mathematicians and theoretical scientists, and is essential for any serious work with trigonometric series. The exercise sets are a particularly attractive feature of this book. A great many of the exercises are projects of many parts which, when completed in the order given, lead the student by easy stages to important and interesting results. Many of the exercises are supplied with copious hints. This new printing contains a large number of corrections and a short author biography as well as a list of selected publications of the author.</p><p>Stromberg's book gives an excellent treatment of real analysis. Making no assumption that the reader is familiar with "baby real variables," it starts from the beginning and develops the Lebesgue theory of measure and integration, then applies the techniques to a study of Fourier analysis. The book is a classic, suitable as a text for the standard graduate course.

These structures, meticulously planned, extravagantly furnished, and regularly frequented by the devout, were more than just places of worship and sacrifice. They were pictures of God's relationship with his chosen people and of the atoning work that would be done by the Messiah. To understand the tabernacle and the temple, then, is to understand how we are brought into God's family through the sacrifice of his only Son, Jesus.<br><br>Visually stunning and theologically rich, this full-color resource brings together the latest scholarship and archeological discoveries to bring God's dwelling places alive for modern believers. It places these important structures in their historical and theological contexts, connects them with the overall biblical story, and shows how they bring meaning and depth to the faith of Christians today.</p><p><b>J.

To his legion of followers, he appeared to be a peaceful, contented monk advocating the contemplative life, but in 1966 he was a troubled, lonely monk&#x2015;sad, demoralized, guilt-stricken, and depressed over past sins. Despite being promoted by the Catholic Church as its great teacher and philosopher, Merton struggled with his irreverent behavior toward women and never having learned how to love, and be loved. </p><p>Only when the suffering Merton fell madly in love with a student nurse, a forbidden, erotic affair condemned by the Catholic Church, would he discover whether his devotion to God was stronger than his dedication to the woman he called "a miracle in my life." Truly an inspirational story based on Merton's personal journals, new information and sources such as fellow monks, Beneath the Mask of Holiness presents a unique portrayal of the famous man, one never revealed in its entirety before.</p></p><p><p><b>Mark Shaw</b> is the author of fifteen books.

Sooner or later, you have a board of directors, three to five (or even seven) Type A personalities who seek your attention and at times will tell you what to do. While you might be hesitant to form a board, establishing an objective outside group is essential for startups, especially to keep you on track, call you out when you flail, and in some cases, save you from yourself.</p> <p>In <i>Startup Boards</i>, Brad Feld&#x2015;a Boulder, Colorado-based entrepreneur turned-venture capitalist&#x2015;shares his experience in this area by talking about the importance of having the right board members on your team and how to manage them well.

As you develop your business, especially after you raise capital, you should have a board of directors--usually three to seven individuals who'll seek your attention and, at times, tell you what to do. You'll also discover that with the formation of a board come the inevitable board meetings.</p> <p>So how does an entrepreneur manage this beast called the board, which has many heads, and even more opinions? Indeed, dealing with this aspect of a startup can be tricky for anyone. That's why Brad Feld--a Boulder, Colorado-based entrepreneur turned venture capitalist--and seed investor Mahendra Ramsinghani have written <i>Startup Boards</i>. In it, they skillfully demystify board dynamics and the inner workings of a boardroom for today's entrepreneur.</p> <p>Establishing an objective outside group is essential for startups, especially to keep you on track, provide you with support and advice, call you out when you flail, and, in some cases, save you from yourself. Here, you'll not only gain a better understanding of the softer dynamics involved with startup boards, but you'll also become familiar with the various legal and governance aspects associated with them.</p> <p>Along the way, Feld and Ramsinghani detail the best practices that can make startup boards more effective. They, along with twenty other entrepreneurs, board members, and lawyers, share their real-world experience in this area, and provide examples of what works, and, equally as important, what doesn't. From proactively building a high-performing board and running more productive meetings to learning by sitting on the boards of other organizations, this book offers valuable insights into a necessary part of any successful startup.</p> <p>Engaging and informative, <i>Startup Boards</i> is a practical guide to one of the most important pieces of the startup puzzle.</p></p><h2>The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano: Written by Himself (The Bedford Series in History and Culture)</h2><p><br>More than just a fascinating story, Olaudah Equiano's autobiography -- the first slave narrative to be widely read -- reveals many aspects of the eighteenth-century Western world through the experiences of one individual. This edition is the first in more than twenty-five years to offer the complete text of the <i>Life</i> together with a comprehensive twenty-page introduction and useful editorial apparatus designed to help students get the most out of this important work. Also included are illustrations, a chronology, questions for consideration, a bibliography, and an index.<br></p><p>Edited and with Notes by Shelly Eversley<br>Introduction by Robert Reid-Pharr <br>In this truly astonishing eighteenth-century memoir, Olaudah Equiano recounts his remarkable life story, which begins when he is kidnapped in Africa as a boy and sold into slavery and culminates when he has achieved renown as a British antislavery advocate. The narrative "is a strikingly beautiful monument to the startling combination of skill, cunning, and plain good luck that allowed him to win his freedom, write his story, and gain international prominence," writes Robert Reid-Pharr in his Introduction. "He alerts us to the very concerns that trouble modern intellectuals, black, white, and otherwise, on both sides of the Atlantic." <br>The text of this Modern Library Paperback Classic is set from the definitive ninth edition of 1794, reflecting the author's final changes to his masterwork.<p>Born in Nigeria in 1745, Olaudah Equiano was a well-known African abolitionist. Equiano was shipped to the West Indies as a child-slave, and then to England where he was purchased by Lieutenant Michael Pascal and trained as a seaman before serving in The Seven Years War. At the conclusion of hostilities, Pascal did not free Equiano as promised, but instead sold him to Captain James Doran who then sold Equiano to James King, a merchant from Philadelphia. In 1765, King let Equiano purchase his freedom for forty pounds, and helped him earn money in his stead as a merchant. Now a free man, Equiano returned to London where he made significant contributions to the abolitionist movement, and published his autobiography, The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African, which influenced the Slave Trade Act of 1807. Equiano is believed to have died in 1797 at the age of 52.</p></p><h2>Introduction to Statistical Pattern Recognition (Computer Science &amp; Scientific Computing)</h2><p>This completely revised second edition presents an introduction to statistical pattern recognition.

Twelve thousand years into the future, the human race has spread across the galaxy to hundreds of terraformed worlds. The effects of the Fall have been diminished by the Great Intervention, and peace and contentment reign under the gentle rule of the Assembly. But suddenly, almost imperceptibly, things begin to change. On the remotest planet of Farholme, Forester Merral D&#x2019;Avanos hears one simple . . . <i>lie.</i> Slowly a handful of men and women begin to realize that evil has returned and must be fought. What will this mean for a people to whom war and evil are ancient history? Thus begins the epic that has been described as &#x201c;If C. S.

A trillion people live under the gentle rule of the Assembly on over a thousand Made Worlds. Peace and stability have reigned for nearly twelve thousand years, and war and evil are merely ancient history. But all that is about to change. <br><br>On Farholme&#x2014;a Made World at the edge of the Assembly&#x2014;strange and troubling things are happening. Slowly, incredulously, a handful of men and women come to recognize the unthinkable: Evil has returned once more, and it must be fought. Forester Merral D&#x2019;Avanos and his friends are entrusted with the daunting task of confronting their world&#x2019;s elusive enemy. <br><br>Now isolated from the rest of the Assembly, Farholme must fight its battles alone. It falls to Merral to lead the untried forces of Farholme into war against opponents well-hidden and armed with strange powers. Yet even as he faces extraordinary and terrifying foes, Merral finds he has an unexpected enemy&#x2014;himself.Born in Wales, <b>Chris Walley</b> grew up in northern England.

Over the course of the 1850s, the world was reshaped by technology, trade, mass migration and war. The global economy expanded fivefold, millions of families emigrated to the ends of the earth to carve out new lives, technology revolutionized how people communicated, and a steamships and railways cut across vast continents and oceans, shrinking the world and creating the first global age. It was a decade of breathtaking and remorseless transformation, fueled by the promise of exponential progress.<br><br> In <i>Heyday</i>, the acclaimed historian Ben Wilson recreates this time of explosive energy and dizzying change, a rollercoaster ride of booms and busts. The 1850s were witness to the laying of the first undersea cable in 1851, the rush for gold from California to Australia, and fleets of pirate vessels docked in Hong Kong harbor, eager to take advantage of booming trade. The West's insatiable hunger for land, natural resources, and new markets encouraged free trade, bold exploration, and colonization like never before.<br><br> Buoyed by supreme self-confidence&#x2014;as well as new technologies of war&#x2014;nations clashed across the globe, and indigenous peoples fell victim to an assurgent West. Reckless economic expansion led to lasting ecological damage, and to the demise of local cultures which could not keep pace with the blistering pace of capitalism and free trade. In <i>Heyday</i> we encounter Muslim guerrilla fighters in the Caucasus Mountains and freelance empire-builders in the jungles of Nicaragua, British free trade zealots preying on China and samurai warriors resisting Western incursions in Japan.<br><br> A dazzling history of a tumultuous decade, <i>Heyday</i> traces the origins of our globalized world order.<br></p><p><b>Ben Wilson</b> received his MPhil in history from Cambridge University.

Its mention brings back nostalgic memories of the rich red machines with flamboyant bold striping, lithe of appearance, and, seemingly even at rest, poised for flight. Its distinctive trademark was the staccato bark of its high revving, side valve engine. This was joined in later years by the quiet hum of the smooth-running four cylinder models which could assume a lightning burst of acceleration and an impudent snarl at a touch of the throttle. The cadences of both were to echo through nearly every country of the world. There were over two dozen makers of motorcycles on the market during the heyday of motorcycling in the United States. Yet in the mids of many enthusiasts, none of these quite approached the verve, style, artistic funtionality of design or handling abilities of the Indian. The Iron Redskin is the story of that most loved of American motorcycles. It is a vast work which has taken many thousands of hours to compile, yet it is one of the most readable and interesting histories ever to be published. Because the Indian motorcycle was manufactured during some of the most exciting and changing years of America&#39;s history, much of that excitement and change comes through, albeit carried on the saddle of a motorcycle. It is pure motorcycling history told with the pace and grace of a classic V-twin, Indian style!&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Mindfulness-Based Eating Solution: Proven Strategies to End Overeating, Satisfy Your Hunger, and Savor Your Life</h2><p><p><b>What are you really hungry for?

Joseph Masco offers the first anthropological study of the long-term consequences of the Manhattan Project for the people that live in and around Los Alamos, New Mexico, where the first atomic bomb, and the majority of weapons in the current U.S. nuclear arsenal, were designed. Masco examines how diverse groups--weapons scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory, neighboring Pueblo Indian Nations and Nuevomexicano communities, and antinuclear activists--have engaged the U.S. nuclear weapons project in the post-Cold War period, mobilizing to debate and redefine what constitutes "national security."</p><br><p> In a pathbreaking ethnographic analysis, Masco argues that the U.S. focus on potential nuclear apocalypse during the Cold War obscured the broader effects of the nuclear complex on American society. The atomic bomb, he demonstrates, is not just the engine of American technoscientific modernity; it has produced a new cognitive orientation toward everyday life, provoking cross-cultural experiences of what Masco calls a "nuclear uncanny." Revealing how the bomb has reconfigured concepts of time, nature, race, and citizenship, the book provides new theoretical perspectives on the origin and logic of U.S. national security culture. <i>The Nuclear Borderlands</i> ultimately assesses the efforts of the nuclear security state to reinvent itself in a post-Cold War world, and in so doing exposes the nuclear logic supporting the twenty-first-century U.S. war on terrorism.</p></p><p><p>The <i>Nuclear Borderlands</i> alters the meaning of 'ethnography' in a way that will challenge all of us in anthropology. It will certainly take its place among the classic texts assessing the cultural politics of the bomb, and it will join the must-read ranks in the literature on American nationalism and nation-making in the late twentieth century."<b>--Susan Harding, University of California, Santa Cruz, author of <i>The Book of Jerry Falwell</i> and <i>Remaking Ibieca</i></b></p><p>"No account of the post Cold War environment can afford to ignore this study and the tangle of economic, political, and cultural rights, interests, and imperatives it maps. Joe Masco pushes the ethnographic agenda firmly forward into an ambivalent twenty-first century, where Los Alamos is both dangerous polluter and lifeline employer, where rival eco-cultures, ethnicities, and social hierarchies fight over control of nature, and where the technological future can exacerbate or redeem the nuclear past. Neither antinuclear environmentalists, nor Native Americans, nor Nuevomexicanos, nor the Los Alamos scientists, nor the Washington politicians have a monopoly on the answers, and Masco shows us why."<b>--Michael M. J. Fischer, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, author of <i>Emergent Forms of Life and the Anthropological Voice</i></b></p><p>"Joseph Masco's argument that nuclear weapons are no longer a technology subject to scientific challenge but rather exist primarily as powerful cultural constructs takes us a long way toward understanding post-Cold War continuities in U.S. security strategies, as well as some of the astounding aspects of American exceptionalism in international politics."<b>--John Borneman, Princeton University</b></p><b>Joseph Masco</b> is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the University of Chicago.</p><h2>The Constitution of the United States and The Declaration of Independence</h2><p><b>Including a new introduction by eminent civil libertarian and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Alan Dershowitz, this edition of the US Constitution is a must-have for all Americans and anyone interested in American history.</b><br><br>This quick, easy reference for our federal government&#x2019;s structure, powers, and limitations includes:<br><ul><li>Introduction by Alan Dershowitz (author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Case Against Impeaching Trump</i>)</li><li>The Constitution of the United States</li><li>The Bill of Rights</li><li><i>All</i> Amendments to the Constitution</li><li>The Declaration of Independence</li></ul><br><b>The Constitution of the United States</b> and <b>The Declaration of Independence</b> are two of the most important documents in American history.

He was subsequently sent to a concentration camp, from which he was released in 1956. Rehabilitated in 1957, he now teaches mathmatics and physics in a secondary school in Ryazan.</p><p>Solzhenitsyn&#39;s first book, this economical, relentless novel is one of the most forceful artistic indictments of political oppression in the Stalin-era Soviet Union. The simply told story of a typical, grueling day of the titular character&#39;s life in a labor camp in Siberia, is a modern classic of Russian literature and quickly cemented Solzhenitsyn&#39;s international reputation upon publication in 1962. It is painfully apparent that Solzhenitsyn himself spent time in the gulags--he was imprisoned for nearly a decade as punishment for making derogatory statements about Stalin in a letter to a friend.From the icy blast of reveille through the sweet release of sleep, Ivan Denisovich endures. A common carpenter, he is one of millions viciously imprisoned for countless years on baseless charges, sentenced to the waking nightmares of the Soviet work camps in Siberia. Even in the face of degrading hatred, where life is reduced to a bowl of gruel and a rare cigarette, hope and dignity prevail. This powerful novel of fact is a scathing indictment of Communist tyranny, and an eloquent affirmation of the human spirit.</p><h2>Music in the Human Experience: An Introduction to Music Psychology</h2><p><p>All human societies in every corner of the globe engage in music.

In depicting her own classroom struggles, Nancie Atwell shook our orthodox assumptions about skill-and-drill-based curriculums and became a pioneer of responsive teaching. Now, in the long awaited second edition, Atwell reflects on the next ten years of her experience, rethinks and clarifies old methods, and demonstrates new, more effective approaches. </p> <p>The second edition still urges educators to "come out from behind their own big desks" to turn classrooms into workshops where students and teachers create curriculums together. But it also advocates a more activist role for teachers. Atwell writes, "I'm no longer willing to withhold suggestions and directions from my kids when I can help them solve a problem, do something they've never done before, produce stunning writing, and ultimately become more independent of me." </p><p>More than 70 percent of the material is new, with six brand-new chapters on genres, evaluation, and the teacher as writer. There are also lists of several hundred minilessons, and scripts and examples for teaching them; new expectations and rules for writing and reading workshops; ideas for teaching conventions; new systems for record keeping; lists of essential books for students and teachers; and forms for keeping track of individual spelling, skills, proofreading, homework, writing, and reading. </p><p>The second edition of <i>In the Middle</i> is written in the same engaging style as its predecessor. It reads like a story&#x2014;one that readers will be pleased to learn has no end. As Atwell muses, "I know my students and I will continue to learn and be changed. I am resigned&#x2014;happily&#x2014;to be always beginning for the rest of my life as a teacher."</p></p><p>NANCIE ATWELL teaches seventh-and eighth-grade writing, reading, and history at the Center for Teaching and Learning, a K-8 demonstration school she founded in Edgecomb, Maine, in 1990. Nancie was the first classroom teacher to receive the NCTE David H. Russell Award and the MLA Mina P.

Stabilize them with one arm and one leg to free up your other arm so that you can spread them one at a time. This way you won&#x2019;t have to set them down, then pick them back up to spread them. (See photo.) <br></li> <li>Select a straight plate for the top and double plates, and position any crown in the double plate in the opposite direction of the top plate crown. This will help straighten out the wall.&nbsp;</li> </ol><strong>Nailing Walls </strong><br><ol> <li>Nail the headers to the studs first. Make sure that they are flush on top and on the ends of the headers. <br></li> <li>Nail the trimmers to the studs. Make sure that they are up tight against the bottom of the header and flush with the sides of the stud. <br></li> <li>Nail the studs and cripples to the plates. Nail sills to the cripples and the trimmers. Make sure that all the connections are tight and flush. <br></li> </ol><strong>Squaring Walls </strong><br><ol> <li>Align the bottom plate so that when it is raised, it will be as close to the final position as possible. <br></li> <li>Attach the bottom plate to the floor along the inside chalk line for the wall. Toenail through the bottom plate into the floor so that the sheathing won&#x2019;t cover the nails. If the wall is in position, it can be nailed on the inside, and the nails can be pulled out after the wall is raised. <br></li> <li>Use your tape measure to check the diagonal lengths of the wall. <br></li> <li>Move the top part of the wall until the diagonal lengths are equal. Example: If the diagonal measurements are different by one inch, then move the long measure toward the short measure by one half inch diagonal measure. Make sure the measurements are exact. <br></li> <li>Once the diagonals are the same, check by measuring the other diagonal. <br></li> <li>Temporarily nail the top of the wall so that it will not move while you are sheathing it. Make sure you nail so that your nails won&#x2019;t be covered by the sheathing.</li> </ol><p><b>Scot Simpson</b>, owner of S.S.

(The writer who famously advised other novelists to &#x2018;make &#x2018;em laugh, make &#x2018;em cry, make &#x2018;em wait&#x2019; is now known to have kept entire households in different parts of England going simultaneously.) Yet Collins also wrote a succession of extraordinarily powerful novels of private life; of these <em></em>The Evil Genius is among the finest. </p> <p> The story is motivated by the attraction between Herbert Linley and the woman he hires as governess for his child Kitty&#x2015;the long suffering Sydney Westerfield. As one expects with Collins, the story is driven forward with deft assurance. Yet he also treats the theme of adultery and divorce in a manner quite unconventional for his time&#x2015;and, remarkably, he manages to draw readers into a sympathetic understanding of both of the main female characters: the offending governess and the aggrieved wife. </p> <p> <em>The Evil Genius</em> was a very considerable success when first published; indeed, it brought Collins more financially than any of his other works. Over a century later its sinews retain the strength to speak powerfully to the reader; lively and intelligent, it is perhaps the finest of Collins&#x2019; later novels.</p> <p></p></p><p>The Broadview Literary Texts series is an effort to represent the ever-changing canon of literature in English by bringing together texts long regarded as classics with valuable, though lesser-known literature.<p> <strong>Graham Law</strong> is an associate professor of English Studies at Waseda University, Japan, and the author of <em>Reading Contemporary English Fiction</em>.

Reprint.</p><p><p>Richard Marcinko's revelations in his explosive #1 bestselling autobiography, <i>Rogue Warrior</i>, reverberated through the highest levels of the U.S. government. But, bound by government restrictions, he was forbidden to tell the whole story. The answer was fiction. First came <i>Rogue Warrior: Red Cell</i>, the take-no-prisoners bestseller with Marcinko as hero. Now the Rogue Warrior's back and he's hotter than ever, in a knockout novel of courage and nonstop action. </p><p>In Portsmouth, England, an aircraft carrier has been sabotaged, killing the American Chief of Naval Operations, one of the few friends the Rogue Warrior had left in the Navy. Marcinko discovers a holy war is brewing -- a violent religious movement, encircling the globe and zeroing in on the West. Defeating that menace will be the supreme test of Marcinko's GREEN TEAM, a top-secret unit operating outside the U.S. military's chain of command. But in Washington, the political wolves select Dick Marcinko as their sacrificial lamb. For the Rogue Warrior it's time to declare a holy war of his own. The enemy may have the ultimate weapon, but GREEN TEAM has Marcinko's Tenth Commandment of SpecWar: </p><p>There Are No Rules -- Thou Shalt Win at All Cost!</p>The Rogue Warrior and his colleague are back in the third hard-boiled thriller derived from Marcinko's real career as a SEAL who specialized in counterterrorist work. This one, more obviously fictional than <i>Red Cell</i> [Mr 1 94], concerns the assassination of a U.S. chief of naval operations and character Marcinko's pursuit of the assassins. His own government is on Marcinko's tail, a deadly danger of germ warfare hangs over the whole world, and Marcinko can rely only on his hard-bitten SEAL colleagues for help. They, of course, come through, filling the memorably fast-paced yarn with vivid, hardware-laden detail. Marcinko is no more concerned about being palatable to the socially sensitive than ever, so readers who cannot tune out his soldier-of-fortunish asides must endure raised eyebrow fatigue, but that does not gainsay the book's admirable readability for thriller fans. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>The Routledge Historical Atlas of Religion in America (Routledge Atlases of American History)</h2><p>First Published in 2001.

The stage play <i>Krapp&#x2019;s Last Tape</i> evolves a shattering drama out of a monologue of a man who, at age sixty-nine, plays back the autobiographical tape he recorded on his thirty-ninth birthday.<br>The two radio plays were commissioned by the BBC; <i>All That Fall</i> plumbs the same pessimistic depths [as <i>Waiting for Godot</i>] in what seems a no less despairing search for human dignity&#x201d; (London <i>Times</i>), and <i>Embers</i> is equally unforgettable theater, born of the ramblings of an old man and his wife. Finally, in the two pantomimes, Beckett takes drama to the point of pure abstraction with his portrayals of, in <i>Act Without Words I</i>, frustrated desired, and in <i>Act Without Words I</i>, corresponding motions of living juxtaposed in the slow despair of one man and the senselessly busy motion of another.</p><p>Samuel Beckett was born in Dublin in 1906. He was educated at Portora Royal School and Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated in 1927. He made his poetry debut in 1930 with Whoroscope and followed it with essays and two novels before World War Two. He wrote one of his most famous plays, Waiting for Godot, in 1949 but it wasn&#39;t published in English until 1954. Waiting for Godot brought Beckett international fame and firmly established him as a leading figure in the Theatre of the Absurd. He received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1961. Beckett continued to write prolifically for radio, TV and the theatre until his death in 1989.</p><h2>One More Time: The Best of Mike Royko</h2><p>With the incisive pen of a newspaperman and the compassionate soul of a poet, Mike Royko was a Chicago institution who became, in Jimmy Breslin's words, "the best journalist of his time." Culled from 7500 columns and spanning four decades, from his early days to his last dispatch, the writings in this collection reflect a radically changing America as seen by a man whose keen sense of justice and humor never faltered. Faithful readers will find their old favorites and develop new ones, while the uninitiated have the enviable good fortune of experiencing this true American voice for the first time.<br><br>"A treasure trove lies between these covers. Royko was in a class by himself. He was a true original."&#x2014;Ann Landers<br><br>"The joy of <i>One More Time</i> is Royko in his own words."&#x2014;Mary Eileen O'Connell, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Reading a collection of Royko's columns is even more of a pleasure than encountering them one by one, and that is a large remark for he rarely wrote a piece that failed to wake you up with his hard-earned moral wit. Three cheers for Royko!"&#x2014;Norman Mailer<br><br>"Powerful, punchy, amazingly contemporary."&#x2014;Neil A. Grauer, <i>Cleveland Plain Dealer</i><br><br>"This crackling collection of his own favorite columns as well as those beloved by his fans reminds us just how much we miss the gruff, compassionate voice of Mike Royko."&#x2014;Jane Sumner, <i>Dallas Morning News</i><br><br>"A marvelous road map through four decades of America."&#x2014;Elizabeth Taylor, <i>Chicago Tribune Books</i><br><br>"Royko was an expert at finding universal truths in parochial situations, as well as in the larger issues&#x2014;war and peace, justice and injustice, wealth and poverty&#x2014;he examined. Think of <i>One More Time</i> as one man's pungent commentary on life in these United States over the last few decades."&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br><br>"Royko was one of the most respected and admired people in the business, by readers and colleagues alike. . . . Savor [his sketches] while you can."&#x2014;Jonathan Yardley, <i>Washington Post Book World</i><br><br>"Book collections of columns aren't presumed to be worth reading. This one is, whether or not you care about newspapering or Chicago."&#x2014;Neil Morgan, <i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i><br><br>"A treasure house for journalism students, for would-be writers, for students of writing styles, for people who just like to laugh at the absurdity of the human condition or, as Studs Terkel said, for those who will later seek to learn what it was really like in the 20th century."&#x2014;Georgie Anne Geyer, <i>Washington Times</i><br><br>"Full of astonishments, and the greatest of these is Royko's technical mastery as a writer."&#x2014;Hendrik Hertzberg, <i>New Yorker</i><br><br>"A great tribute to an American original, a contrarian blessed with a sense of irony and a way with words."&#x2014;Bob Minzesheimer, <i>USA Today</i><br><br>"In this posthumous collection of his columns, journalist Royko displays the breezy wit that made him so beloved in the Windy City."&#x2014;<i>People</i><br></p><p><b>Mike Royko</b> was born in Chicago in 1932 and for much of his youth lived in the flat above his family's tavern on Milwaukee Avenue. Not only did he become the most widely read columnist in Chicago history, but his column was syndicated in more than 600 newspapers across the country. He was also the author of the classic account of city machine politics, <i>Boss</i>. Mike Royko's last column in the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> appeared in March 1997, a month before his death. His memorial service was held on a sunny day in Wrigley Field.<br>An insightful, at times amusing walk through America's collective psyche and history by one of this century's most popular newspaper columnists. For nearly 35 years, Royko (Like I Was Sayin' . . ., 1984, etc.) entertained newspaper readers and alternately cajoled and aggravated bureaucrats. By the time the Chicago-based Pulitzer Prizewinning writer died in 1997, his columns were syndicated in more than 600 papers nationwide, and his ``characters'' (convenient pals, such as Slats Grobnik, who acted as literary foils) were fixtures in many Americans' lives. Here his widow and some longtime colleagues have culled 100 of Royko's best from nearly 8,000 columns. They are remarkable on many levels, not least for his ability to churn out five columns weekly (his only real break came after the death of his first wife). Royko also impresses with the breadth of his work. Sometimes he is the outraged muckraker: ``A Faceless Man's Plea'' decries the Veterans Administration for refusing to pay for plastic surgery that would enable a Vietnam veteran to chew food once more. (The VA changed its mind almost within hours of the column appearing in print.) At other times he is the voice of just-plain-folks, questioning exactly why our government is acting in a particular way. Sometimes he's just funny, as in the columns bemoaning his allegedly ugly feet. A gruff, no-holds-barred writer, Royko spoke for the many who are voiceless. Despite his success and the rise of celebrity journalists, he remained refreshingly unimpressed with himself. ``I just hope my next column is readable, doesn't bore people, he said in a 1993 interview. I don't have any grand scheme.'' Yet the continued relevance of these columns reminds us that good journalists can make a difference. A terrific compendium for those who always meant to clip and save Royko's words but didn't. (17 photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

While credit for its genius has traditionally been attributed solely to its director, Orson Welles, Carringer's pioneering study documents the shared creative achievements of Welles and his principal collaborators. <i>The Making of Citizen Kane</i>, copiously illustrated with rare photographs and production documents, also provides an in-depth view of the operations of the Hollywood studio system.</p><p>Ever since Pauline Kael wrote her controversial essay "Raising Kane" (available in print in her omnibus collection <i>For Keeps</i>), film fans and scholars have debated the "authorship" of <i>Citizen Kane</i>. Most audiences and critics agree that it is one of the greatest American movies, but Kael claimed that the genius behind <i>Kane</i> was not writer-director-producer-actor Orson Welles, but coscenarist Herman Mankiewicz. Others attribute the film's power to the influence and contributions of John Houseman or the incredible innovations of cinematographer Gregg Toland. In this superbly researched book, Robert Carringer proves conclusively that <i>Kane</i> is not the product of any individual artist, but the collective work of a brilliant team working under Welles's supervision. Without Mankiewicz, Toland, and the talented designers and technicians who worked on the film, <i>Kane</i> could never have become what it is. As Carringer covers each step of the film's production, from conception to final release, he leads readers through the enormously complex process of making a great movie. He also provides an introductory chapter about an unfilmed project Welles worked on before <i>Kane</i>, an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's <i>Heart of Darkness</i>. In his concluding chapter on <i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i>, Welles's follow-up to <i>Kane</i>, Carringer argues that the latter film suffered precisely because its collaborators failed to achieve the artistic harmony that had made <i>Kane</i> so successful. <i>--Raphael Shargel</i><b>Robert L.

The presidential election between Adams and Jefferson was a bitterly contested tie, and the government neared collapse. The Supreme Court had no clear purpose or power&#x2014;no one had even thought to build it a courtroom in the new capital city. When Adams sought to prolong his policies in defiance of the electorate by packing the courts, the fine words of the new Constitution could do nothing to stop him. It would take a man to make those words good, and America found him in John Marshall.<p><i>The Great Decision</i> tells the riveting story of Marshall and of the landmark court case, <i>Marbury v. Madison</i>, through which he empowered the Supreme Court and transformed the idea of the separation of powers into a working blueprint for our modern state.

Cliff Sloan and David McKean's new book, <i>The Great Decision</i>, tells a wonderful tale of how the decision -- which established that the Supreme Court had the power to declare an act of Congress unconstitutional -- came to be. To produce this impressive and gripping narrative, they culled newspaper accounts and diaries and conducted a wide-ranging array of interviews, including with Justice John Paul Stevens, who went back and analyzed his law school notes -- which he apparently has kept all these years.&#x201d;</p><p><b><i>Library Journal</i>, 3/1</b><br>&#x201c;A lucid and compelling account of the well-known but seldom understood court battle that secured the place of the judiciary as a coordinate branch of the federal government....

Tillmans first made a name for himself in the early 1990s, with photographs that captured an entire generation and a youth culture of which he was part, and which are now iconic images of that era. However, he quickly expanded his focus, creating works with and without a camera, producing photographs printed as C-prints on photographic paper, as inkjet prints on paper, or as photocopies. Some of these photographs acquire a sculptural, objectlike quality. Tillmans has also developed new compositional and formal, anti-hierarchical ways of installing his pictures in spaces. This substantial, clothbound volume offers a comprehensive overview of his achievements.</p><p><b>Wolfgang Tillmans</b> (born 1968) began his career in photography documenting Hamburg&#x2019;s rave scene in the late 1980s. His earliest images were printed on digital copiers, and in the mid-1990s, living in London and then New York, Tillmans began to foreground the lo-fi properties of his printed images by exhibiting them pinned or taped to gallery walls. In 2005, at an exhibition at Maureen Paley gallery titled <i>Truth Study Center</i>, he further extended this approach by exhibiting photographs alongside newspaper cuttings, pamphlets and other kinds of printed matter, on custom-made wooden vitrines. This installation also brought to the fore more political themes in Tillmans&#x2019; photography. In 2011 he traveled to Haiti to document reconstruction efforts following the previous year&#x2019;s earthquakes.</p></p><p>Wolfgang Tillmans was born in Remscheid, Germany in 1968 and studied at Bournemouth &amp; Poole College of Art and Design. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential artists of his generation. His work, whilst appearing to capture the immediacy of the moment and character of the subject, also examines the dynamics of photographic representation. From the outset he ignored the traditional separation of art exhibited in a gallery from images and ideas conveyed through other forms of publication, giving equal weight to both. His expansive floor to ceiling installations feature images of subcultures and political movements, as well as portraits, landscapes, still-lives and abstract imagery varying in scale from postcard- to wall-sized prints. His work has been shown at the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 1996 and Tate Britain, London, in a major retrospective in 2003. He was awarded the Turner Prize in 2000.These two new works are united by the fact that each of the twentysomething artists earned a place in this fall's round-up of best new photographers at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. In a book devoid of text (even the copyright information is on the back cover), Billingham presents an extended album of his family's life in the projects near Birmingham, England. The brutally frank snapshots center on Ray, Richard's alcholic father, Liz, his chainsmoking mother, and his brother Jason. Mostly disturbing yet sometimes beautiful, the haunting images seem to carry the burden of documentation, declaring their existence to be a necessary proof. Tillmans, a German photographer who has lived and worked in Hamburg, London, and New York intermingles without distinction his art images and his fashion and portrait work for magazines. This catalog for a one person show at the Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg collects a diverse selection of his images. Sequenced by Tillmans, the catalog places a special emphasis on the landscapes and still lifes that have often been overlooked by critics who have labeled Tillmans the documentarian of an urban Generation X. The three short essays offer some of the most cogent writing on the photographer to date. Both books belong in larger libraries collecting contemporary artists' works.?Eric Bryant, "Library Journal"<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Casebook in Child Behavior Disorders</h2><p>Reflecting the latest research from the field, CASEBOOK IN CHILD BEHAVIOR DISORDERS, 5e vividly illustrates the rich and arresting nature of disorders that first manifest themselves in childhood while also showing how a child&#39;s developmental patterns shape the expression of each disorder.

Engineering programs must demonstrate that their graduates have specific abilities. These include: </p> <ul> <li>an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering</li> <li>an ability to analyze and interpret data</li> <li>an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs</li> <li>an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems</li> <li>an ability to communicate effectively</li> <li>an ability to use techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice.</li> </ul> <p><b>Goals of the Text</b></p> <p> A course in the kinematics and dynamics of machinery provides many opportunities to develop the abilities listed above. This text is designed to help foster development and application of those skills. One goal is to develop the ability of students to formulate and solve problems in the kinematics and dynamics of machinery. Engineering tools used to achieve this goal include motion simulation software and general-purpose mathematical software. These tools relieve the designer of repetitive tasks and provide a powerful means of communicating results through graphs and animation simulations. An equally important goal is the development of an understanding of the implications of computed results. That is, what do the results mean; how can we improve the design? Knowledge gained in previous courses is reinforced when applied to problems in the kinematics and dynamics of machinery. For example, matrix methods become meaningful when applied to equations describing velocities and accelerations in a spatial linkage. The skills learned and sharpened in studying the kinematics and dynamics of machinery are carried forward, even to unrelated courses and to engineering practice. </p> <p><b>Scope</b></p> <p> The coverage of this text includes mechanisms and machines, basic concepts; motion in machinery; velocity and acceleration analysis of mechanisms; design and analysis of cams, gears, and drive trains; static and dynamic force analysis; synthesis; and an introduction to robotic manipulators. Practical applications are considered throughout the text. Example problems and homework problems involve engineering design and provide a basis for design courses to follow. Analytical and graphical vector methods are illustrated, as well as complex number methods. </p> <p> The text illustrates the use of motion simulation software, mathematics software, and user-written programs to solve problem and to present the results in plotted or tabulated form. </p> <p> There are also many problems that can be solved by "hand calculations," however, using only a scientific calculator and/or simple drafting tools. The latter group may be useful as short practice problems and examination problems when laptop computers are unavailable. </p> <p><b>What's New in the Third Edition?</b></p> <p> The text was updated throughout. A few of the changes and additions include: </p> <ul> <li>A list of "Concepts you will learn and apply . . . ." for each chapter.</li> <li>Chapter summaries</li> <li>Review and discussion items for each chapter</li> <li>Thorough revision of the material on cam design, including application of step and interval functions, and higher order polynomials for cam design.</li> <li>Practical design implications of results Gear train diagnostics based on noise and vibration frequencies</li> <li>Updates, example problems and homework using motion simulation software Updates example problems and homework problems using mathematics software throughout the text.</li> <li>Other updates for clarity and brevity</li> <li>Suggestions for "working smart," particularly with computers. Emphasis on computer-aided matrix solutions where appropriate</li> <li>Interpretation and assessment of results. Is it logical? Does it check? Let's compare results with another solution. What does it mean? What does the graph show?</li> <li>Practical design implications of results</li> </ul> <p><b>Course Development</b></p> <p> Professors who regularly teach the kinematics and dynamics of machinery will know what topics suit their students best. This note is for instructors who have not taught the course recently. </p> <p> Most of the topics in this text can be covered in a three-credit-hour course given to engineering students who have completed a course in the statics and dynamics of rigid bodies. But a single course designed around the entire book would be likely to have insufficient depth. Instructors may decide to cover the parts of the text that they deem essential, and then select additional topics and solution methods according to goals set for their students. For example, either analytical vector methods or complex number methods may be used as a basis for writing computer programs to solve planar linkages. However, if analysis of spatial linkages is to follow analysis of planar linkages, then vector methods might be used for both. </p> <p> For courses built around the use of motion simulation software and mathematics software, graphical methods are likely to be de-emphasized. For example, the velocity polygon might be used only to spot check a detailed analytical velocity analysis of a planar linkage. In a course concerning the kinematics and dynamics of machinery, uniformity of course content is not essential. Differences in emphasis and methods among university engineering departments may strengthen the "gene pool" of future engineers. </p> <p> We have attempted to provide sufficient rigor and advanced material to challenge the student and provide a basis for further study. Student creativity may be fostered by the demands of the task, particularly if a few homework problems are expanded into open-ended design-type projects. Additional projects requiring creativity may be suggested by articles in technical publications or by an instructor's current research and consulting. </p> <p><b>Disclaimer</b></p> <p> The kinematics and dynamics of machinery and the design of mechanisms involve modeling of physical systems. Relationships so developed have limits of applicability. The user of this text is urged to interpret the results of calculations, rather than simply obtain problem solutions. It is the reader's responsibility to assess formulas and methods to determine their applicability to a particular situation. Although the publisher, the reviewers, and the authors have made every effort to ensure accuracy, errors invariably creep in.

But, as organizational guru and former Google CIO Douglas C. Merrill points out, it isn't our fault. Our brains simply aren't designed to deal with the pressures and competing demands on our attention in today's fast-paced, information-saturated, digital world. What's more, he says, many of the ways in which our society is structured are outdated, imposing additional chaos that makes us feel stressed, scattered, and disorganized.<br><br>But it doesn't have to be this way. Luckily, we have a myriad of amazing new digital tools and technologies at our fingertips to help us manage the strains on our brains and on our lives; the trick is knowing when and how to use them. This is why Merrill, who helped spearhead Google's effort to "organize the world's information," offers a wealth of tips and strategies for how to use these new tools to become more organized, efficient, and successful than ever. <br><br>But if you're looking for traditional, rigid, one-size-fits-all strategies for organization, this isn't the book for you. Instead, Merrill draws on his intimate knowledge of how the brain works to help us develop fresh, innovative, and flexible systems of organization tailored to our individual goals, constraints, and lifestyles. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>From how to harness the amazing power of search, to how to get the most out of cloud computing, to techniques for filtering through the enormous avalanche of information that assaults us at every turn, to tips for minimizing distractions and better integrating work and life, <b>Getting Organized in the Google Era</b> is chock-full of practical, invaluable, and often counterintuitive advice for anyone who wants to be more organized and productive&#x2013;and less stressed--in our 21st-century world.</p><p><p>DOUGLAS C MERRILL is the Founder &amp; CEO of ZestCash - a financial services technology company committed to serving the underbanked - and was previously Chief Information Officer and Vice President of Engineering at Google.

How to Master the Art of Search<br>&nbsp;<br>In this chapter:<br>Crawling the Web<br>Getting the Most Relevant Search Results<br>Your Search Engine Is Also a Calculator<br>The Small Stuff <br>Searching Your Computer <br>&nbsp;<br>More than any other technology or innovation, search makes it possible for us to survive and thrive in the information age. Like oxygen, which changes everything it touches, the ability to quickly search computer files, e-mails, calendar entries, databases, and the Web has changed how we store information, how we retrieve it, how we use it. In other words, search has set us free from the clutter of our imperfect minds.<br><br>Thanks to search, you no longer have to neatly organize all your information the way you used to, with a place for everything and everything in its place. It&#x2019;s as if you no longer have to hang up all your clothes. Instead, you can just toss them into an ever-growing pile, and when you want to wear your favorite Nine Inch Nails T-shirt, just ask for it, and it will magically surface to the top of the heap. How freeing.<br><br>Over the past ten to fifteen years, computer-assisted search has become an integral part of our lives. It&#x2019;s evolved from something only academics and scientists could do on their monster computers into something most of us perform instinctively, multiple times daily. We breathe, we blink, we eat, we sleep, we Google. <br><br>As a result, most of us haven&#x2019;t paid much attention to search. In fact, by now we&#x2019;ve pretty much taken it for granted. But search is actually a skill, one that&#x2019;s essential to the new organization. The savvier you become at search, the better you can filter out what&#x2019;s not important and focus on what is. The ability to perform quick, targeted searches helps you find the information you need faster. And you don&#x2019;t have to expend mental capacity trying to anticipate where to look for a piece of information or trying to figure out where the heck to put it. You just search for what you want, and <i>voilï¿½</i>. <br><br>So let&#x2019;s work on mastering search. In this chapter, I&#x2019;ll share some strategies and tips for getting the best results to your queries. My focus here is on Google because the majority of people use it.[i] And despite its many competitors, I believe Google, with its streamlined search interface and sophisticated algorithms for delivering the most relevant results, continues to offer the best search engine. (Okay, it doesn&#x2019;t hurt that I used to work there either.) For ideas about other search engines, see the &#x201c;Stuff We Love&#x201d; appendix. That&#x2019;s where you&#x2019;ll find a brief guide to the tools and services I&#x2019;ll talk about in Part II, along with suggestions for alternatives.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Crawling the Web</b><br>Google and most search engines use automated software agents called <i>crawlers, </i>also known as <i>spiders</i> or <i>robots</i>. Crawlers visit Web sites frequently, reading and capturing most of a page&#x2019;s text as well as following links to other pages within the site. <br>The information about a site the crawler collects is added to the search engine&#x2019;s index of Web pages. The index is like a library&#x2019;s card catalog&#x2014;except the catalog is constantly revised and includes a card not just for every book but for every chapter of every book and every article in every periodical in every library in the world. <br><br>When you perform a query, the search engine rapidly analyzes the information in its index to find matches. The results of your search are listed in order of relevance, with the most relevant pages listed first. (I&#x2019;m talking, of course, about <i>organic</i> search results, not the paid results, that is, advertisements, you see at the very top and on the right side of Google search results pages.)<br><br>The search engine determines what&#x2019;s most relevant to your query using many different factors. Google uses over 100 factors, including where on the page your search term appears and how often the term appears. For example, I just did a search on the word <i>videoconferencing</i>, and Google found millions of pages (as of this moment in time, 2,020,000, to be exact). Among the top search results at that time were a Wikipedia entry and a <i>BusinessWeek </i>article. In both cases, the word <i>videoconferencing</i> appeared in the Web page&#x2019;s title (that&#x2019;s where location comes in). And the word showed up at least four times within the first 250 words of the entry and article (that&#x2019;s the frequency factor at work). <br><br>While most search engines follow this general model, no two search engines do things exactly the same. That explains why you can get different results using the same term on different search engines. <br><br>Google&#x2019;s PageRank[ii] algorithm is one of the ways Google differs from other search engines. When Google&#x2019;s cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin met, they were both graduate students in computer science at Stanford University. They had a class project to come up with a way to find valuable information within piles of data. This project led to the development of PageRank.<br><br>PageRank judges the likelihood that a particular Web page is &#x201c;good&#x201d; in the same way we tend to judge other people. For example, if you ran into a stranger on the street and, for some odd reason, he started to explain search to you, you probably wouldn&#x2019;t take him seriously. Why should you? He&#x2019;s a stranger. You have no way of knowing if what he says is legitimate.<br><br>However, you bought this book, and you&#x2019;re reading this chapter. Quite possibly, you believe I have something useful to say about search. Why are you inclined to believe me, and not the stranger on the street? Mostly, it&#x2019;s because the publisher wouldn&#x2019;t have let me write this book if I didn&#x2019;t know what I was talking about. (Right?) In other words, you believe me because someone you trust (the publisher) trusts me. <br>PageRank essentially works in the same manner. Instead of asking people it trusts, PageRank looks to see if Web pages link to the page it&#x2019;s ranking. It &#x201c;trusts&#x201d; Web pages more that have more sites linked to them. In other words, if lots of sites link to a page, that page for some reason must be worthy of all those links. Thus, that page is probably &#x201c;good.&#x201d; And, as such, it receives a higher PageRank, which helps move it up in Google search results. By the way, you might assume that PageRank got its name because it ranks Web pages. But you&#x2019;d be wrong. In a pun, Larry Page named it after himself. <br><br>Ranking search results accurately is difficult to do, primarily because there&#x2019;s a lot of complexity in our language. For example, if I told you only that I went to the bank, would you know for certain that I went to a place to get money? Or would you think I&#x2019;d been hanging out by the side of a river? Similarly, if you did a search for <i>apples,</i> how would the search engine know if you were looking for results related to a fruit or for a particular technology company? Google algorithms make an educated guess based on enormous amounts of data compiled from millions and millions of past searches. In this case, Google guesses that usually, if you type <i>apples</i> as a search word, you&#x2019;re probably searching for information about the fruit. Google hedges its bets a bit; the top search results you&#x2019;re likely to get will be for the fruit as well as for the technology company. However, if you enter <i>apple,</i> the odds increase markedly that you&#x2019;re looking for the technology company. In this case, your top search results are overwhelmingly related to Apple the company. Thus, Google gives different rankings of results depending on whether the <i>s</i> is there or not. For other searches, it can get even more complicated. That&#x2019;s why Google and its competitors employ hundreds of engineers to constantly tune their engines to deliver the most relevant results.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Getting the Most Relevant Search Results</b><br>Okay, we&#x2019;ve peeked under the hood to see how the engine works. Now let&#x2019;s get behind the wheel and explore how to get the most from a Google search. Google searches (google.com) are quick and easy, and they usually deliver the results you&#x2019;re looking for. But sometimes, the results are too broad for what you need and you end up with page after page of results it would take hours to sift through. If that happens, there are ways to tweak your standard Google search to get better results. Here are a few:<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Be as descriptive as possible.</b> If you simply type <i>apple</i>, as in the earlier example, you&#x2019;ll get hundreds of millions of search results. But if what you&#x2019;re really searching for is information about engraving an Apple iPod Touch, you should use a search phrase like <i>apple ipod touch engrave</i>. Your search results will be much more targeted to your interests. (I&#x2019;ve italicized search terms in this chapter just to set them apart; you don&#x2019;t need to italicize search phrases.)<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Use quotation marks around a phrase.</b> When you add quotes around two or more words, Google (and other search engines) will give you only those pages with that exact phrase. For example, let&#x2019;s pretend you&#x2019;re heading to Paris this summer for vacation (lucky <i>vous</i>) and you want to research hotels. If you simply search for the words <i>Paris hotels</i>, Google will look for pages relating to hotels with the two words used somewhere in relatively close proximity to one another on the page. Google will usually assume you&#x2019;re searching for those words together as a phrase, but it&#x2019;s just guessing. As a result, the first few pages of search results may direct you to the Web page for &#x201c;The Paris Las Vegas Hotel &amp; Casino.&#x201d; Not exactly what you are looking for. On the other hand, using quotation marks around the two words will confine your search results to Web pages where the two words <i>&#x201c;Paris hotels&#x201d;</i> are used as a phrase, thus excluding this somewhat less exotic (though I suppose that&#x2019;s debatable) vacation destination in the desert. (Searches on Google and other engines don&#x2019;t have to be case sensitive. So it&#x2019;s okay to type <i>paris</i> instead of <i>Paris</i>.) <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Search for adjectives.</b> You don&#x2019;t want to get information about just any Paris hotel; after all, you&#x2019;re on a budget. You could narrow your results by including the words <i>affordable</i>, <i>cheap</i>, and <i>budget</i> in your search. And try using various synonyms&#x2014;you might think it&#x2019;s great if a hotel is <i>cheap</i>, but its marketing team probably prefers to bill it as <i>affordable</i>. There are several ways you could do this in Google. <br><br>Type this search string <i>&#x201c;paris hotels&#x201d; ~affordable </i>in Google (this trick doesn&#x2019;t usually work in other search engines). Placing the tilde symbol (~) immediately before a word tells Google to look for Web pages containing the word (in this case, <i>affordable</i>) and others like it (such as <i>cheap</i>, <i>budget</i>, and other synonyms). Be careful <i>not</i> to put a space between the tilde symbol and the word you want to search for. Alternatively, you could type this: <i>&#x201c;paris hotels&#x201d; affordable OR cheap OR budget</i>. Your search results will include pages containing the phrase <i>Paris hotels</i> and at least one of the words <i>affordable</i>, <i>cheap</i>, or <i>budget</i>. By the way, <i>OR</i> when used in all caps is a standard search operator, so it should work with most search engines. What&#x2019;s the difference between using the tilde symbol and <i>OR</i>? The tilde symbol is a wild card, giving Google carte blanche to find all the pages it thinks have words similar to <i>affordable</i>. In contrast, using <i>OR</i> will give you fewer search results because you&#x2019;re telling Google to look for pages containing only the words <i>affordable</i>, <i>cheap</i>, or <i>budget</i>. Bottom line: If you&#x2019;re trying to narrow your results, use <i>OR</i> so you can specify the synonyms you want. <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Exclude what you don&#x2019;t want.</b> You want to buy a digital camera to take on your Paris excursion, but for whatever reason, you don&#x2019;t like Nikons. (I&#x2019;m not knocking Nikon; I just needed an example here.) Here&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;d type in Google (and in most other search engines): <i>digital camera </i>&#x2013;<i>Nikon </i>(or to be even more precise, <i>&#x201c;digital camera&#x201d; &#x2013;Nikon</i>). The minus symbol, placed immediately before the word <i>Nikon </i>with no space between them, tells Google to search for pages about digital cameras from all manufacturers other than Nikon. <br><br>Here&#x2019;s another way the minus sign is useful in a search. Imagine that you&#x2019;re trying to find general information about opera, as in &#x201c;O Sole Mio,&#x201d; and not Opera, the Web browser. In your Google search, you&#x2019;d type <i>opera -browser</i>. Your results will include only pages about the musical art form, not the Web browser.<br><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br><b>Get specific with numeric ranges. </b>On Google, an ellipsis (three consecutive periods) can be used to express a range of numbers. So if you want to specify exactly how affordable that digital camera should be, you could type this in Google: <i>&#x201c;digital camera&#x201d; $100 . . . $300. </i>That will tell Google to narrow its results to digital cameras costing between $100 and $300. (This trick doesn&#x2019;t always work in other search engines.)<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Search a particular site. </b>&nbsp;While most Web sites offer tools for searching their own pages, these tools are sometimes suboptimal. What many people don&#x2019;t know is that you can use Google to search the content of a specific Web site. Because its algorithms are more sophisticated than the search tools used by most typical Web sites, you&#x2019;ll usually get better results using Google (though more and more sites are using Google-powered search these days).

Among the titles are <em>Peter&#x2019;s Dream</em>, <em>I Don&#x2019;t Like Peas</em>, and <em>The New Bike</em> (the latter two published under the pen name Marie Vinje), the <em>Get Ready for Preschool</em>, <em>Kindergarten</em>, and<em> First Grade </em>workbook trio, along with the entire Get Ready, Little Thinker, I Know It!, Try-n-Spy, and Little Busy Book workbook series.</p> <p>She is also co-founder, along with her late husband James Hoffman, Ph.D., of School Zone Publishing. Visionary in business, she has long looked at the world through a child&#x2019;s eyes, infusing her stories and lessons with joy and relatability.</p> <p>&nbsp;As a mother of 4 back in the &#x2018;70s, like moms the world over throughout history, she wanted what was best for her children. And she knew that teachers didn&#x2019;t have the time to give her kids everything they needed. As an elementary school teacher, Hoffman worked hard to give her students what they needed to learn. And parents would ask her what they could do to help. That&#x2019;s why she started School Zone&#x2014;to help give children every possible chance to reach their potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>She brought retail experience gleaned from previously founding and managing two regional educational book and supply stores for teachers and parents. Her husband lent his blended talents of educator and entrepreneur. A professor of education who also had first-hand experience as an elementary teacher, he was involved in teacher education programs at several colleges and had served at the helm of a company that published classroom materials.</p> <p>Combining rock-solid editorial judgment and creative instincts with a thorough understanding of early education, Joan Hoffman was an exemplary proponent of design thinking long before it became a conceptual label. An innovative problem-solver, she has always sought to reach out to end users and challenge convention. Separating fleeting trends from legitimate advances has been essential to her company&#x2019;s longevity.</p> <p>The results speak for themselves. With the next generation&#x2014;both son Jonathan and daughter Jennifer&#x2014;taking on creative and strategic leadership roles in the company their parents started, School Zone seamlessly integrated digital learning platforms. The company received Apple&#x2019;s exclusive Human Interface Design Excellence Award for software development, and its apps were part of the first-generation iPad launch in 2010. School Zone&#x2019;s flagship product, the Little Scholar Learning Tablet, has earned industry-wide recognition and awards, as has its online learning destination Anywhere Teacher. Inspired by mom&#x2019;s story-telling excellence, son Jonathan continued that legacy with Charlie &amp; Company, an original series for ages 3-7, available on Oznnoz, Kidoodle.tv, ToonGoggles, BatteryPop, Ameba, and Highbrow.</p> <p>Joan Hoffman says, &#x201c;It is incredibly rewarding to see the children and grandchildren of some of our original customers enjoying our ever-evolving books, apps, flash cards, games, music, and other products&#x2014;both print and digital.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> In 2019 School Zone celebrates its 40th anniversary, spanning portions of five decades and having sold more than 370 million educational products.

Simpson case</p><p>Two crusading journalists investigate the FBI's forensic crime lab and deliver a strong indictment against what goes on there. Federal agents regularly dupe the public into accepting "scientific" findings that aren't based upon science at all, they charge, and the lab is infected with a troubling culture where truth plays second fiddle to prosecutorial interests, with information potentially useful to defendants withheld. The book's hero is FBI-scientist-turned-whistle-blower Frederic Whitehurst, and most of the chapters focus on the crime lab's controversial role in high-profile cases involving O.J. Simpson, the World Trade Center bombing, the Unabomber, and others. The authors at times appear to have a pro-prosecution bias of their own, but their conclusions shouldn't be ignored. They probably won't be; as one attorney tells the authors, "No defense lawyer in the country is going to take what the FBI lab says at face value anymore." <i>--John J. Miller</i>The media has familiarized the public with the vocabulary of forensic science: DNA identification, fingerprinting, bomb signatures, etc. However, as journalists Kelly and Wearne make clear in this expose of the FBI crime lab, some of these practices are dubious at best, and any of them is only as effective as the scientist behind it. The book was prompted by the complaints lodged against the bureau by FBI crime-lab scientist Fred Whitehurst, and the congressional inquiries that arose from his whistle-blowing. The problem Whitehurst identified is twofold. First, the bureau allegedly puts so much faith in its reputation that it refuses to submit to external certification even as it fails to maintain state-of-the-art labs. Second, the FBI lab is said to operate as a good-ol'-boy network, promoting unqualified agents and often taking direction from field investigators. Kelly and Wearne detail how the FBI crime lab's alleged arrogance and incompetence has, they say, affected the investigation of six high-profile cases, with apparent offenses ranging from laziness and bungling in the Unabomber, O.J. Simpson and Oklahoma City cases to possible perjury in the World Trade Center bombing case and conspiracy to withhold evidence in the investigation of the FBI assault on Ruby Ridge and a series of bomb attacks on federal judges in the late 1980s. Their book is painstakingly researched and highly detailed, but the abundance of information?some of it shocking?doesn't excuse its bone-dry, tedious presentation. In any case, this volume belongs on the reading list of any criminal defense attorney as a road map to the successful cross-examination of forensics experts. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Algebra Foundations: Basic Mathematics, Introductory Algebra, and Intermediate Algebra</h2><p>The<b>&nbsp;Bittinger&nbsp;Worktext&nbsp;Series</b>&nbsp;recognizes that math hasn&#x2019;t changed, but students&#x2013;and the way they learn math&#x2013;have.

The Seventh Edition, as in the past, includes new cases, as well as updates in the notes that bring current issues of criminal law to the fore.</p><p></p><h2>The Poems of Exile: Tristia and the Black Sea Letters</h2><p>In the year A.D. 8, Emperor Augustus sentenced the elegant, brilliant, and sophisticated Roman poet Ovid to exile&#x2015;permanently, as it turned out&#x2015;at Tomis, modern Constantza, on the Romanian coast of the Black Sea. The real reason for the emperor's action has never come to light, and all of Ovid's subsequent efforts to secure either a reprieve or, at the very least, a transfer to a less dangerous place of exile failed. Two millennia later, the agonized, witty, vivid, nostalgic, and often slyly malicious poems he wrote at Tomis remain as fresh as the day they were written, a testament for exiles everywhere, in all ages. <br><br>The two books of the <i>Poems of Exile, </i>the <i>Lamentations (Tristia) </i>and the <i>Black Sea Letters (Epistulae ex Ponto), </i>chronicle Ovid's impressions of Tomis&#x2015;its appalling winters, bleak terrain, and sporadic raids by barbarous nomads&#x2015;as well as his aching memories and ongoing appeals to his friends and his patient wife to intercede on his behalf. While pretending to have lost his old literary skills and even to be forgetting his Latin, in the <i>Poems of Exile </i>Ovid in fact displays all his virtuoso poetic talent, now concentrated on one objective: ending the exile. But his rhetorical message falls on obdurately deaf ears, and his appeals slowly lose hope. A superb literary artist to the end, Ovid offers an authentic, unforgettable panorama of the death-in-life he endured at Tomis.</p><p>"This is no small achievement. For the language-lover the translation provides elegant, flowing English verse, for the classicist it conveys close approximation to the Latin meaning coupled with a sense of the movement and rhythmic variety of Ovid's language"&#x2015;Geraldine Herbert-Brown, editor of <i>Ovid's Fasti: Historical Readings at its Bimillennium</i><br><br>"This book fills a gap. There is no similar annotated English translation of Ovid's exile poetry. Thoroughly grounded in Ovidian scholarship, Green's introduction and notes are helpful and informative. The translation is accurate, idiomatic, and lively, closely imitating the Latin elegiac couplet and capturing Ovid's changing moods."&#x2015;Karl Galinsky, author of <i>Ovid's Metamorphoses: An Introduction to the Basic Aspects</i><b>Peter Green</b> is Dougherty Centennial Professor Emeritus of Classics at the University of Texas at Austin and Adjunct Professor of Classics at the University of Iowa.He is the author of many books, including <i>Alexander of Macedon, 356-323 B.C.: A Historical Biography </i>(California, 1991) and <i>Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age</i> (California, 1990).His translations include <i>Juvenal: The Sixteen Satires</i> (third edition, 1998) and <i>Apollonios Rhodios: The Argonautika </i>(California, 1997).</p><h2>101 Careers in Social Work, Second Edition</h2><p><p><b>PRAISE FOR THE FIRST EDITION:</b></p> <p><i>This is a vital and necessary guide to the social work profession.

You may think you've read all there is about Jack the Ripper, Lizzie Borden, and the Lindbergh kidnapping, but Douglas has a few surprise conclusions in his modern analysis of these gripping crimes. By applying criminal personality profiling techniques he developed while stalking more current killers, Douglas provides a fresh, sage outlook on some disturbing history. He also sheds new light on San Francisco's Zodiac Killer, the Black Dahlia murder, Bambi Bembenek, the Boston Strangler, and the continuing mystery of who killed 6-year-old JonBenï¿½t Ramsey. Douglas sometimes reveals his chief suspect; other times he simply narrows down who the killer is not. In the JonBenï¿½t mystery (in which Douglas was hired by the Ramseys to find the killer), he presents a convincing case for why he believes the girl's parents are not guilty of murder. Douglas is founder of the FBI's Serial Killer Profiling Unit. His method of solving a crime by entering the mind of the killer inspired Thomas Harris's book <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>. In this dissection of our most sensational crimes, Douglas proves that reality can be more horrifying than fiction. <i>--Jodi Mailander Farrell</i>11 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Real World Nursing Survival Guide: IV Therapy</h2><p>Nursing students struggling with the difficult area of IV therapy need a resource that guides them through the essentials and highlights what they need to know.

Editor Stephen Cope has made a judicious selection of Oppen's extant writings outside of poetry, including the essay "The Mind's Own Place" as well as "Twenty-Six Fragments," which were found on the wall of Oppen's study after his death. Most notable are Oppen's "Daybooks," composed in the decade following his return to poetry in 1958. <i>Selected Prose, Daybooks, and Papers </i>is an inspiring portrait of this essential writer and a testament to the creative process itself.</p><p>"Stephen Cope approaches Oppen's various prose writings--essays, bound daybooks and papers of interest&#x2015;with the same intensive and self-reflexive care that Oppen's poems cultivate toward the world. This is exemplary editing of exemplary thinking. I was surprised and delighted by many of the particulars, especially a brilliantly measured review of Charles Olson. But the major revelation was the range and precision and constructivist architecture that went into Oppen's Daybooks: they rival his books of poetry, as if <i>Minima Moralia </i>could thrive on amphetamines."&#x2015;Charles Altieri<br><br>"George Oppen's daybooks, prose and papers offer the singular record of a mind determinedly thinking toward poetry, the world and human company, and that elusive point where they converge. In these pages, scrupulously assembled, edited and annotated by Stephen Cope, we find the groundwork for some of the finest American verse of the twentieth century. The collection should prove invaluable to those interested in the often fitful, yet resolute, steps along the way of truths not easily attained."&#x2015;Michael Palmer, author of <i>Company of Moths</i><br><br>"Any number of poets keep notebooks, but George Oppen's are unique in their rigor, their conceptual profundity, and especially their ethical awareness and insistent self-criticism. Stephen Cope's meticulously edited and annotated collection of Oppen's "Daybooks," short critical essays, and fugitive pieces should be required reading for anyone who cares about the place of poetry in the post-World War II era. With his characteristic modesty, Oppen didn't set out to formulate a full-scale aesthetic; he just happened to produce one of the finest we have."&#x2015;Marjorie Perloff, author of <i>Radical Artifice: Writing Poetry in the Age of Media</i><br><br>"Here is the essential record of George Oppen's indelible voice, astonishing as it wanders and discovers a new mode 'between the grim gray lines of the Philistines and the ramshackle emplacements of Bohemia' in order to recover an open ground that is, in the fact, ' the function of poetry to serve as a test of truth.' Few documents in our time would better serve to illuminate the hard-won life of being a poet in the American language than this volume, brilliantly edited by Stephen Cope. Simply put, what a laboratory is to hard science, these daybooks are to poetry."&#x2015;Peter Gizzi, author of <i>The Outernationale</i><b>George Oppen</b> (1908&#x2013;1984) was born in New York and died in San Francisco.

And it seems, from media portrayals, that this is happening more and more frequently. But is religious change between generations common? How does religion get passed down from one generation to the next? How do some families succeed in passing on their faith while others do not? <em>Families and Faith: How Religion is Passed Down across Generations</em> seeks to answer these questions and many more. <br><br>For almost four decades, Vern Bengtson and his colleagues have been conducting the largest-ever study of religion and family across generations. Through war and social upheaval, depression and technological revolution, they have followed more than 350 families composed of more than 3,500 individuals whose lives span more than a century--the oldest was born in 1881, the youngest in 1988--to find out how religion is, or is not, passed down from one generation to the next. <br><br>What they found may come as a surprise: despite enormous changes in American society, a child is actually more likely to remain within the fold than leave it, and even the nonreligious are more likely to follow their parents' example than to rebel. And while outside forces do play a role, the crucial factor in whether a child keeps the faith is the presence of a strong fatherly bond. Mixing unprecedented data with gripping interviews and sharp analysis, <em>Families and Faith</em> offers a fascinating exploration of what allows a family to pass on its most deeply-held tradition--its faith.<br></p><p><br><strong>Vern L.

What would we learn about what practices do (and do not) effectively pass on the faith? In this brilliantly researched study of over 3000 subjects and over 300 multi-generational families, Vern Bengtson turns some of the most widely accepted conventional wisdom about faith transmission on its ear. Written in a warm, engaging style, this book is a must read for parents, grandparents, and leaders who long to see faith faithfully passed on to the coming generations." --Mark DeVries, Founder, Youth Ministry Architects; Associate Pastor for Youth and Their Families, First Presbyterian Church, Nashville, Tennessee <br><p></p><br>"Research on the religious and spiritual lives of American young people and on the transmission of religious faith across generations has grown tremendously in recent years. <em>Families and Faith</em> makes a major and very impressive contribution to our knowledge in these areas, using data across multiple generations to shed light on processes at work over long stretches of time.

Rowny Professor of Religion and Society Emeritus, Research Professor, University of California at Santa Barbara <br><p></p><br>"As Bengtson puts it, we experience continuity and change. Those two realities - faiths are transmitted but also evolve over time - matter beyond our own homes. Religion and families are two of the most stabilizing forces in society.

The book addresses, spot on, the most important question about religion that sociologists can be asking. And it pursues the question in a rigorous way." --<em>Contemporary Sociology</em> <br><p></p><br>"For several decades, Vern Bengtson's research has helped define how family factors influence religiosity across the life course, and in <em>Families and Faith</em>, he and his colleagues go well beyond their previous examinations to give a detailed qualitative and quantitative portrait of the dynamic relationship between family and faith... Overall, Families and Faith is the most important empirical study on religion and family published in several decades. The analyses are solid and clearly presented, and the qualitative data complement the quantitative analyses and make the book an interesting read.

Carolan, PhD, 01/2006</b></p><h2>The Travels of Marco Polo</h2><p>Marco Polo was the most famous traveller of his time. His voyages began in 1271 with a visit to China, after which he served the Kubilai Khan on numerous diplomatic missions. On his return to the West, he was made a prisoner of war and met Rustichello of Pisa, with whom he collaborated on this book. The accounts of his travels provide a fascinating glimpse of the different societies he encountered: their religions, customs, ceremonies and way of life; on the spices and silks of the East; on precious gems, exotic vegetation and wild beasts. He tells the story of the holy shoemaker, the wicked caliph and the three kings, among a great many others, evoking a remote and long-vanished world with colour and immediacy.</p><p>Marco Polo's account of his journey throughout the East in the thirteenth century was one of the earliest European travel narratives, and it remains the most important. The merchant-traveler from Venice, the first to cross the entire continent of Asia, provided us with accurate descriptions of life in China, Tibet, India, and a hundred other lands, and recorded customs, natural history, strange sights, historical legends, and much more. From the dazzling courts of Kublai Khan to the perilous deserts of Persia, no book contains a richer magazine of marvels than the Travels. <br>This edition, selected and edited by the great scholar Manuel Komroff, also features the classic and stylistically brilliant Marsden translation, revised and corrected, as well as Komroff's Introduction to the 1926 edition.Jason Goodwin&#x2019;s books include <b>A Time for Tea: Travels Through China</b> and <b>India in Search of Tea; On Foot to the Golden Horn: A Walk to Istanbul;</b> and L<b>ords of the Horizons: A History of the Ottoman Empire</b>.</p><h2>The Road to Guilford Courthouse: The American Revolution in the Carolinas</h2><p>A brilliant account of the proud and ferocious American fighters who stood up to the British forces in savage battles crucial in deciding both the fate of the Carolina colonies and the outcome of the war.<br><br>"A tense, exciting historical account of a little known chapter of the Revolution, displaying history writing at its best."--Kirkus Reviews<br><br>"His compelling narrative brings readers closer than ever before to the reality of Revolutionary warfare in the Carolinas."--Raleigh News &amp; Observer.<br><br> "Buchanan makes the subject come alive like few others I have seen." --Dennis Conrad, Editor, The Nathanael Greene Papers.<br><br>"John Buchanan offers us a lively, accurate account of a critical period in the War of Independence in the South. Based on numerous printed primary and secondary sources, it deserves a large reading audience." --Don Higginbotham, Professor of History, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.</p><p>Most of us are familiar with the role that North and South Carolina played in the American Civil War: if nothing else, every grade-schooler knows the significance of the 1861 bombardment of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. But to popular historian John Buchanan, "that tragedy is of far less interest than the American Revolution. The Revolution was the most important event in American history. The Civil War was unfinished business." And the Carolinas, Buchanan convincingly argues, were the most critical theater in that conflict, with their wild Back Country seeing "a little-known but savage civil war far exceeding anything in the North."<p> <i>The Road to Guilford Courthouse</i> is no less than a tour de force of pop military scholarship, an exhaustive battle-by-battle account of the Crown's grinding march to wrest the Carolinas from the resourceful Rebels. Beginning with Colonel William Moultrie's valiant defense atop the palmetto ramparts of Fort Sullivan against an outnumbering force of British men-of-war to the final "long, obstinate, and bloody" exchange at Guilford Courthouse, Buchanan meticulously recounts each skirmish, battle, and shift of strategy in the campaign. Relying on copious primary and secondary sources, he brings the combatants to life, from the worthy but somewhat obscure, such as Nathanael Greene, whom George Washington considered to be his successor should he fall, to soon-to-be legends such as Francis Marion, the Swamp Fox. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>A popular historian presents a riveting portrait of the participants and events of a critical campaign during the American Revolution. Buchanan vividly describes the backgrounds and characters of such key figures as Lord Cornwallis, Nathanael Greene, Horatio Gates and Francis, &#34;The Swamp Fox,&#34; Marion, offering fresh perspectives and evaluations of their performance. He discusses the severe social and political tensions between the &#34;Low Country&#34; and the &#34;Back Country&#34;--conditions that had a profound impact on the nature and duration of the campaign.</p><h2>Bobbi Lee: Indian Rebel</h2><p>Bobbi Lee confronts white Canadian society on the ground that it stole from the First Nations of this country.

Covering a wide geographical canvas, from America to the Far East, Steiner provides an indispensable reassessment of the most disputed events of these tumultuous years. <br><br>Steiner underlines the far-reaching consequences of the Great Depression, which shifted the initiative in international affairs from those who upheld the status quo to those who were intent on destroying it. In Europe, the l930s were Hitler's years. He moved the major chess pieces on the board, forcing the others to respond. From the start, Steiner argues, he intended war, and he repeatedly gambled on Germany's future to acquire the necessary resources to fulfil his continental ambitions. Only war could have stopped him-an unwelcome message for most of Europe. Misperception, miscomprehension, and misjudgment on the part of the other Great Powers leaders opened the way for Hitler's repeated diplomatic successes. <br><br>It is ideology that distinguished the Hitler era from previous struggles for the mastery of Europe. Ideological presumptions created false images and raised barriers to understanding that even good intelligence could not penetrate. Only when the leaders of Britain and France realized the scale of Hitler's ambition, and the challenge Germany posed to their Great Power status, did they finally declare war.<br></p><p><br><strong>Zara Steiner</strong> is Emeritus Fellow, New Hall, University of Cambridge, and a Fellow of the British Academy.<br><br>"<em>The Triumph of the Dark</em> is magisterial in design, meticulous in execution, and curiously oldfashioned in its inclinations.

During the next two centuries European travelers in the Near East came home with increasingly accurate copies of the strange inscriptions to be found there. The great age of decipherment dawned in the mid-eighteenth century, at the time of the Enlightenment, with the Abbe Barthelemy&#39;s solution of the Palmyra script. The author discusses the contributions to the science of decipherment made by theorists and practitioners, examining the intellectual developments that led to their outstanding achievements. He explains the process of decipherment largely from the point of view of the practitioners themselves, but in a way that laypeople can follow. Among the scripts analyzed are the Palmyra script, Sassanid Persian, Egyptian hieroglyphs, Persian cuneiform, Akkadian cuneiform, the Cypriot syllabary, Hittite hieroglyphs, the Ugaritic alphabet, and Mycenaean Linear B. For this revised edition, the text has been brought up to date and a new section added on the decipherment of Maya hieroglyphs.</p><p>Maurice Pope was formerly Professor of Classics at the University of Cape Town.A concise, well-organized study that deserves high marks. -- <i>Library Journal</i><br><br>The finest work of its kind . . . a delight to read. -- <i>Science</i></p><h2>The Big Questions: A Short Introduction to Philosophy</h2><p>Solomon and Higgins&#39;s engaging text covers philosophy&#39;s central ideas in an accessible, approachable manner.

However the new "active interview" considers interviewers and interviewees as equal partners in constructing meaning around an interview. This interpretation changes a range of elements in the interview process - from the way of conceiving a sample to the ways in which the interview may be conducted and the results analyzed. In this guide, the authors outline the differences between active and traditional interviews and give novice researchers clear guidelines on conducting a successful interview. </p></p><p><strong>James A.

The perplexing event has not been adequately accounted for by historians in their large-scale assessments of how and why the Holocaust occurred. In this gripping new analysis, Alon Confino draws on an array of archives across three continents to propose a penetrating new assessment of one of the central moral problems of the twentieth century. To a surprising extent, Confino demonstrates, the mass murder of Jews during the war years was powerfully anticipated in the culture of the prewar years.<br> &nbsp;<br> The author shifts his focus away from the debates over what the Germans did or did not know about the Holocaust and explores instead how Germans came to conceive of the idea of a Germany without Jews. He traces the stories the Nazis told themselves&#x2014;where they came from and where they were heading&#x2014;and how those stories led to the conclusion that Jews must be eradicated in order for the new Nazi civilization to arise. The creation of this new empire required that Jews and Judaism be erased from Christian history, and this was the inspiration&#x2014;and justification&#x2014;for Kristallnacht. As Germans imagined a future world without Jews, persecution and extermination became imaginable, and even justifiable.</p><p>An excerpt from <i>A World Without Jews</i>: <br> <br> A history of the Holocaust must include the history of emotions and imagination of Germans during the Third Reich, for the fundamental reason that the persecution and extermination was built on fantasy. In persecuting and exterminating the Jews, Germans waged a war against an imaginary enemy that had no belligerent intentions toward Germany and possessed no army, state, or government. <br> &nbsp; <br> The essential motivations for this war were not practical, for Germans and Jews did not have a conflict over territory, land, resources, borders, or political power that often characterizes cases of ethnic cleansing and genocide in the modern world. In the mind of the Nazis, this was a war about identity. Nothing about Nazi anti-Semitism was driven by a desire to provide a truthful account of reality. Yet it was nonetheless believed by many Germans and therefore was for them real and truthful. <br> &nbsp; <br> A key to understanding this world of anti-Semitic fantasies is no longer to account for what happenedï¿½the administrative process of extermination, the racial ideological indoctrination by the regime, and the brutalizing warï¿½because we now have sufficiently good accounts of these historical realities. Rather, a key is to account for what the Nazis <i>thought </i>was happening, for how they imagined their world. What was this fantasy created by Nazis and other Germans during the Third Reich, and the story that went along with it, that made the persecution and extermination of the Jews justifiable, conceivable, and imaginable?<b>Alon Confino</b> is professor of History at the University of Virginia and at Ben Gurion University, Israel.

In fact, the reform was based exclusively on contemporary sources, chiefly the 1602 Venice Euchologion (Greek) and seventeenth century South-Slavic editions from Kiev and Striatin. Far from being a &#39;return to the sources,&#39; or a &#39;correction,&#39; the reform consisted simply in the uncritical transposition of contemporary Greek practice onto Russian soil. Part One of Russia, Ritual and Reform is an historical overview of the events and of the chief personages involved in the reform: Patriarch Nikon, Tsar Alexis, Arsenios the Greek, and Epifanii Slavinetskii. We see that the reform was initiated not by Nikon, but by the tsar, and that aligning Russian practice with Greek was part of a grand design to make Moscow the &#39;Third Rome,&#39; the new capital of the Orthodox world. Nikon, an able administrator and close friend of the tsar, was selected as the new patriarch to see the program through. Part Two contains an analysis of the content of the reform, consisting of a comparative study of pre- and post-Nikonian editions of the Sluzhebnik (Euchologion). Particular attention is focused on the text and rubrics of the Byzantine Liturgy of John Chrysostom, which underwent the most significant changes.</p><p>Dr Paul Meyendorff is Associate Professor of Liturgical Theology at St Vladimir&#39;s Orthodox Theological Seminary.</p><h2>Crowns of Glory, Tears of Blood: The Demerara Slave Rebellion of 1823</h2><p>On the night of August 17, 1823, the distinctly African sounds of blaring shell-horns and beating drums signalled the start of one of the most massive slave rebellions in the history of the Western Hemisphere, the uprising in the British colony of Demerara (now Guyana). That evening, nine to twelve thousand slaves surrounded the main houses of about sixty plantations, armed with cutlasses, knives fastened on poles, and guns. They broke down doors, smashed windows, commandeered arms and ammunition, and put their masters and overseers in the stocks. Intent on avoiding a blood bath (over three days of fighting, colonial forces took the lives of more than 255 slaves, while only two or three white men were killed), the rebels spoke of "rights," and planned to present their grievances to the governor. For a few days, the slaves succeeded in turning the world upside down, treating masters the way masters had always treated slaves. Retaliation from colonial officials would be swift, bloody, and brutal.<br> In <em>Crowns of Glory</em>, Emilia Viotti da Costa tells the riveting story of a pivotal moment in the history of slavery. Studying the complaints brought by slaves to the office of the Protector of Slaves, she reconstructs the experience of slavery through the eyes of the Demerara slaves themselves. Da Costa also draws on eyewitness accounts, official records, and private journals (most notably the diary of John Smith, one of four ministers sent by the London Missionary Society to convert Demerara's "heathen"), to paint a vivid portrait of a society in transition, shaken to its foundations by the recent revolutions in America, France, and Haiti. Smith and his wife, Jane, the planters and colonial politicians, and the leaders of the rebellion emerge as flesh-and-blood individuals, players trapped in a complex political game none of them could fully understand.<br> Unravelling the complex web of events leading up to the climactic rebellion, Da Costa explains how Smith, a dedicated but inexperienced minister who arrived at the <em>Le Resouvenir</em> plantation confident that all faithful missionaries would win "a crown of glory that fadeth not away," could seven years later find himself convicted by court martial of fostering rebellion amongst the slaves, and sentenced to be hanged by the neck until dead. She details the colonials' orgy of repression following the rebellion--scores of slaves were sentenced more or less at random to grisly public executions and ritualistic floggings, and Smith died in his cell before news arrived that the Crown had granted him mercy--and shows how it fueled the anti-slavery movement in Britain, leading to the abolishment of slavery in the colonies ten years later.<br> Casting new light on the nuances of racial relations in the colonies, the inevitable clash between the missionaries' message of Christian brotherhood and a social order based on masters and slaves, and the larger historical forces that were profoundly eroding the institution of slavery itself, <em>Crowns of Glory</em> is an original and unforgettable book.</p><p>The night of August 17, 1823 saw the start of one of the most massive slave rebellions in the history of the Western Hemisphere, the uprising in the British colony of Demerara (now Guyana), in which nearly twelve thousand slaves took up arms against their masters.

The seven stories in this collection represent the early part of Mann&#39;s literary career, beginning with work he produced in 1896 at the age of 21, and culminating in his most celebrated novella, &#34;Death in Venice&#34; (1912). Although Mann continued working until the end of his life in 1955, he despaired of ever matching the quality of his early writing. In these stories, Mann began to grapple with themes that were to recur throughout his work. In the first piece, &#34;Little Herr Friedemann,&#34; as in &#34;Death in Venice,&#34; a character&#39;s carefully structured way of life is suddenly and unexpectedly threatened by sexual passion. In &#34;Gladius Dei,&#34; puritanical intellect clashes with beauty. In &#34;Tristan,&#34; Mann presents an ironic and comical account of tension between an artist and bourgeois society. All seven of these stories are accomplished and memorable, but it is &#34;Death in Venice&#34; that truly forms the centerpiece of the collection. Themes that weave their way through many of the shorter stories come to a climax in this novella, out century&#39;s most haunting, magnificent tale of art and self-destruction.Thomas Mann was born in 1875 in Germany. He was only twenty-five when his first novel, <i>Buddenbrooks</i>, was published. In 1924, <i>The Magic Mountain</i> was published, and, five years later, Mann was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Following the rise of the Nazis to power, he left Germany for good in 1933 to live in Switzerland and then in California, where he wrote <i>Doctor Faustus</i> (first published in the United States in 1948). Thomas Mann died in 1955.</p><h2>The Ayurveda Way: 108 Practices from the World&#x2019;s Oldest Healing System for Better Sleep, Less Stress, Optimal Digestion, and More</h2><p>Celebrated Ayurveda teacher Ananta Ripa Ajmera offers an inspiring introduction to this ancient Indian medical tradition, which complements and extends the health and wellness benefits of yoga.

Is ours a good society to be alive in? Is it possible to have a good life in our time? And finally, does a good life consist of having a good time? Are happiness and a good lifeinterchangeable? These are the questions that Mortimer Adler addresses himself to. The heart of the book lies in its conception of the good life for man, which provides the standard for measuring a century, a society, or a culture: for upon that turns the meaning of each man&#39;s primary moral right - his right to the pursuit of happiness. The moral philosophy that Dr. Adler expounds in terms of this conception he calls the ethics of common sense,because it is as a defense and development of the common-sense answer to the question can I really make a good life for myself?</p><p>Is it a good time to be alive? Is ours a good society to be alive in? And finally, does a good life consist of having a good time? Are happiness and a &#34;good life&#34; interchangeable? These are the questions that Mortimer Adler addresses in this book. Carefully, Adler lays the groundwork for a common-sense approach to the problem of making a good life and of evaluating that life in reference to the merits of our present society. Adler offers standards by which we can judge the relative merits of our time against those of previous centuries, other societies and cultures. Adler answers in what ways culture encourages or discourages the individual in his or her efforts to make a good life. Finally, Adler argues for a moral and educational revolution as well as for strenuous efforts to rectify existing injustices by radical social, economic, and political reforms.

Ewell: A Soldier&#39;s Life (Civil War America)</h2><p>General Richard Stoddert Ewell holds a unique place in the history of the Army of Northern Virginia. For four months Ewell was Stonewall Jackson's most trusted subordinate; when Jackson died, Ewell took command of the Second Corps, leading it at Gettysburg, the Wilderness, and Spotsylvania Court House. <br> <br>In this biography, Donald Pfanz presents the most detailed portrait yet of the man sometimes referred to as Stonewall Jackson's right arm. Drawing on a rich array of previously untapped original source materials, Pfanz concludes that Ewell was a highly competent general, whose successes on the battlefield far outweighed his failures. <br><br>But Pfanz's book is more than a military biography. It also examines Ewell's life before and after the Civil War, including his years at West Point, his service in the Mexican War, his experiences as a dragoon officer in Arizona and New Mexico, and his postwar career as a planter in Mississippi and Tennessee. In all, Pfanz offers an exceptionally detailed portrait of one of the South's most important leaders.<br><br><br><br></p><p>Confederate general Richard Ewell has never received the attention he deserves, according to his biographer Donald C. Pfanz. Ewell's many impressive military achievements have gone largely unnoticed, and his few failures--among them arguably blowing an opportunity to turn Gettysburg into a Southern victory--have often served as reasons to blame Confederate losses on anybody but its more revered generals, such as Robert E. Lee. Ewell's greatest accomplishment, suggests Pfanz, was leading third-rate troops in defense of Petersburg when Federal soldiers broke through at Fort Harrison. "Had [Stonewall] Jackson been in charge rather than Ewell, historians would have touted the battle as a military masterpiece. But ... the episode was forgotten. Historians have all but ignored it since." Despite such assessments, <i>Richard S. Ewell: A Soldier's Life</i> is no hagiography; Pfanz cites shortcomings in both Ewell's personality (bad temper) and judgment (at Spotsylvania, for instance). Still, this book is mainly a robust defense of a second-tier general who deserves better than what he's received from other historians."The absence of a detailed, scholarly study of Ewell has been one of the least explicable gaps in the annals of Confederate historiography. Donald C. Pfanz's work covers that lacuna so thoroughly that it is hard to imagine another serious Ewell biography anytime soon. . . . A superb biography of a fascinating man. The combination of dogged research, splendid prose, and an important topic ensure <i>Ewell</i> a place on any shelf of leading books about the Army of Northern Virginia."-- <i>Journal of Southern History</i> <br></p><h2>A Guide to Zuni Fetishes &amp; Carvings, Volume II: The Materials &amp; The Carvers</h2><p>Kent McManis has written a welcome sequel to his immensely popular book that covered the essentials of animal fetish carvings.

Opening this handbook on feline dreams in a matter-of-fact voice, he reinforces the colorless tone of cats' waking existence by enclosing the soft gray-and-white illustrations in controlled black-bordered boxes. Yet by the story's fourth page, as the protagonist nestles drowsily in the lap of an undemonstrative woman whom many readers will recognize as Whistler's mother, ``everything begins to change.'' To emphasize the shift in mood, the scope of the pictures broaden to full or near-full pages, adding vivid, rich colors to the scenes to show what happens When Cats Dream. Exuberant watercolors energize their secret world with a stimulating blend of diverse art styles that derive inspiration from many masters. Cubist cats cavort in an impressionistic jungle, while crudely drawn mice grimace effectively at the somnambulists' antics. Prisms of colors in the backgrounds achieve a stained-glass effect and unify the disparate styles into a harmonious and humorous combination, assuring readers of all ages and levels of visual sophistication a source of satisfaction. When kitty awakes, the world again returns to its colorless predictability, until the next ``softwarm lap'' (this time Mona Lisa's) lulls the cat back to its technicolor slumber. An obvious choice for cat champions, this charmer might also convince reluctant youngsters to snuggle down into their pillows, to sleep, and perchance to dream. --Dorothy Houlihan, formerly at White Plains Public Library, NY<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Communist Manifesto (Vintage Classics)</h2><p>First published in London in 1848, the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>'s&nbsp;impact reverberated across the globe and throughout the next century.

It comes down broad and ale-coloured and joins the Saint Lawrence, the two streams embrace the pan of Montreal Island, the Ottawa merges and loses itself, and the mainstream moves northeastward a thousand miles to the sea.<br><br>Nowhere has nature wasted herself as she has here. There is enough water in the Saint Lawrence alone to irrigate half of Europe, but the river pours right out of the continent into the sea. No amount of water can irrigate stones, and most of Quebec is solid rock. It is as though millions of years back in geologic time a sword had been plunged through the rock from the Atlantic to the Great Lakes and savagely wrenched out again, and the pure water of the continental reservoir, unmuddied and almost useless to farmers, drains untouchably away. In summer the cloud packs pass over it in soft, cumulus, pacific towers, endlessly forming and dissolving to make a welter of movement about the sun. In winter when there is no storm the sky is generally empty, blue and glittering over the ice and snow, and the sun stares out of it like a cyclops&#x2019; eye.<br><br>All the narrow plain between the Saint Lawrence and the hills is worked hard. From the Ontario border down to the beginning of the estuary, the farmland runs in two delicate bands along the shores, with roads like a pair of village main streets a thousand miles long, each parallel to the river. All the good land was broken long ago, occupied and divided among seigneurs and their sons, and then among tenants and their sons. Bleak wooden fences separate each strip of farm from its neighbour, running straight as rulers set at right angles to the river to form long narrow rectangles pointing inland. The ploughed land looks like the course of a gigantic and empty steeplechase where all motion has been frozen. Every inch of it is measured, and brooded over by notaries, and blessed by priests.<br><br>You can look north across the plain from the river and see the farms between their fences tilting toward the forest, and beyond them the line of trees crawling shaggily up the slope of the hills. The forest crosses the watershed into an evergreen bush that spreads far to the north, lake-dotted and mostly unknown, until it reaches the tundra. The tundra goes to the lower straits of the Arctic Ocean. Nothing lives on it but a few prospectors and hard- rock miners and Mounted Policemen and animals and the flies that brood over the barrens in summer like haze. Winters make it a universe of snow with a terrible wind keening over it, and beyond its horizons the northern lights flare into walls of shifting electric colours that crack and roar like the gods of a dead planet talking to each other out of the dark.<br><br>But down in the angle at Montreal, on the island about which the two rivers join, there is little of this sense of new and endless space. Two old races and religions meet here and live their separate legends, side by side. If this sprawling halfcontinent has a heart, here it is. Its pulse throbs out along the rivers and railroads; slow, reluctant and rarely simple, a double beat, a self-moved reciprocation.</p><h2>Extravagaria (Texas Pan American Series) (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p>One of Pablo Neruda&#39;s own favorites among his books, Extravagaria marks an important stage in the progress of his poetry. It was written at the point in his life when he had returned to Chile after many wanderings and moved to Isla Negra on the Pacific coast. These writings celebrate this coming to rest, this rediscovery of the sea and the land, for in Extravagaria Neruda evolved a lyric poetry that is decidedly more personal than his earlier work. Written in what he called his &#34;autumnal&#34; period, the sixty-eight poems range from the wistful to the exultant, combining psalm and speculation, meditation and humorous aside.</p><p><p><b>Pablo Neruda</b> (1904-73), one of the renowned poets of the twentieth century, was born in Parral, Chile. He shared the World Peace Prize with Paul Robeson and Pablo Picasso in 1950, and received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1971.</p>Text: English, Spanish (translation)<br> Original Language: Spanish</p><h2>UNITED STATES HISTORY 2010 MODERN AMERICA STUDENT EDITION GRADE 11/12</h2><p><p>Developed to meet the needs of modern United States history courses.

From India to China, and from Egypt to Chile, Ifrah talked to mathematicians, historians, archaeologists, and philosophers.

Conveying all the excitement and joy of the process of discovery, Ifrah writes in a delightful storytelling style, recounting a plethora of intriguing and amusing anecdotes along the way.</p> <p>From the stories of the various ingenious ways in which different early cultures used their bodies to count and perfected the use of the first calculating machine-the hand-to the invention of different styles of tally sticks, up through the creation of alphabetic numbers, the Greek and Roman numeric systems, and the birth of modern numerals in ancient India, we are taken on a marvelous journey through humankind's grand intellectual epic.</p> <p>We meet those who only count to four-anything more is "a lot"; discover the first uses of counting fingers and toes; learn of the amazing ability of abacus users to calculate with brilliant efficiency; and ponder the intriguing question: How did many cultures manage to calculate for all those centuries without a zero? Exploring the many ways civilizations developed and changed their mathematical systems, Ifrah imparts a unique insight into the nature of human thought-and into the ways our understanding of numbers and how they shape our lives has slowly changed and grown over thousands of years.</p> <p>In this illuminating and entertaining work, you'll learn about:</p> <ul> <li>The earliest calculating machine--the hand</li> <li>Tally sticks--accounting for beginners</li> <li>How the Sumerians did their sums</li> <li>Greek and Roman numerals</li> <li>The invention of alphabetic numerals</li> <li>The achievements of the Mayan civilization</li> <li>India and the birth of modern numbers</li> <li>Indo-Arabic numerals and how they reached the West</li> <li>The final stage of numerical notation</li> </ul> <p>Praise for The Universal History of Numbers</p> <p><i>"Let us start the year with a bang. Georges Ifrah is the man. This book, quite simply, rules. . . . It is outstanding, and not least because it has been written from first principles, for people like you and me, curious but by no means expert . . . a mind-boggling and enriching experience."</i>-The Guardian</p> <p><i>"Pursuing the invention of numbers across civilizations, Georges Ifrah has written the grand story of human ingenuity. . . . His amazing undertaking, describing humankind's relationship with numbers from Paleolithic times to the computer age, spans the world from Mayan ruins to Indian museums, from Egyptian hieroglyphics to Greek philosophers to Chinese libraries."</i>-Le Figaro</p> <p><i>"Follow the astonishing path of Georges Ifrah, the Indiana Jones of arithmetic . . . who decided in 1974 to begin the search for his Grail, the origin of numbers. Journeying over mountains and across valleys, he discovered how-from Mayan to Chinese, from Indian to Egyptian-humankind has juggled numbers."</i>-Express</p> <p><i>"Ifrah's book amazes and fascinates . . . It is nothing less than thehistory of the human race told through figures."</i>-International Herald Tribune</p></p><p>The title doesn't lie. Mathematician Georges Ifrah's masterpiece, <i>The Universal History of Numbers</i>, is a wonderfully comprehensive overview of numbers and counting spanning all the inhabited continents as far back in time as records will allow us to look. Beyond the ancient Babylonians, Sumerians, and Indians, Ifrah takes us farther south into Africa to examine an early decimal counting system and into ancient Mexico to reconstruct what we can of the Mayan calendar and numerical system. The 27 chapters are chiefly organized by culture, though there are some cross-cultural overviews of topics like letters and numbers.<p> The author's aim was grand: "to provide in simple and accessible terms the full and complete answer to all and any questions ... about the history of numbers and counting, from prehistory to the age of computers." This led him to wander the world for 10 years, studying and learning; this scholastic pilgrim has returned with amazing stories to tell. Toward the end of the book, Ifrah makes the book truly universal by refuting alien-intervention theories of cultural origins--surely our benefactors would have given us an efficient decimal counting system, zero and all, before helping us build pyramids and such. Such charming ideas, combined with such rigorously researched facts, make <i>The Universal History of Numbers</i> a uniquely important and fascinating volume. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>"Ifrah&#x2019;s Book Amazes and Fascinates ...

This approach demonstrates how anthropological thinking can be used as a tool for deciphering everyday experiences. The book covers the essential concepts, terms, and history of cultural anthropology, introducing students to the widely accepted fundamentals and providing a foundation that can be enriched by the use of ethnographies, a reader, articles, lectures, field-based activities, and other kinds of supplements.

P. Morgan, and Buffalo Bill Cody&#x2014;helped lay the groundwork for what we now call the American West. They were people of imagination and courage, adept at maneuvering the rapids of change, alert to opportunity, persistent in their missions.<br><br> They had big ideas they were not afraid to test. They stitched the country together with the first transcontinental railroad, invented the Model A and built the roads it traveled on, raised cities and supplied them with water and electricity, established banks for immigrant populations, entertained the world with film and showmanship, and created a new form of western hospitality for early travelers. Not all were ideal role models. Most, however, once they had made their fortunes, shared them in the form of cultural institutions, charities, libraries, parks, and other amenities that continue to enrich lives in the West today.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Out Where the West Begins</i> profiles some fifty of these individuals, tracing the arcs of their lives, exploring their backgrounds and motivations, identifying their contributions, and analyzing the strategies they developed to succeed in their chosen fields.</p><p><b>Philip F.

The universe is the result of a mathematical thinker, thinking mathematically. . . The universe is actually a mental system. Its primary nature is the process of ideas becoming form. Every fact in your world is also an idea in your mind. To get new things in your world you must have new ideas in your consciousness. Few people do enough abstract thinking to create new ideas in their minds . . . The infiltration of new ideas in the mind is essential to healthy living. You exist in an infinite Mind which offers you an ever expanding variety of ideas.

Stack Lee? Stagger Lee? He has gone by all these names in the ballad that has kept his exploits before us for over a century. Delving into a subculture of St. Louis known as "Deep Morgan," Cecil Brown emerges with the facts behind the legend to unfold the mystery of Stack Lee and the incident that led to murder in 1895. </p><p>How the legend grew is a story in itself, and Brown tracks it through variants of the song "Stack Lee"--from early ragtime versions of the '20s, to Mississippi John Hurt's rendition in the '30s, to John Lomax's 1940s prison versions, to interpretations by Lloyd Price, James Brown, and Wilson Pickett, right up to the hip-hop renderings of the '90s. Drawing upon the works of James Baldwin, Richard Wright, and Ralph Ellison, Brown describes the powerful influence of a legend bigger than literature, one whose transformation reflects changing views of black musical forms, and African Americans' altered attitudes toward black male identity, gender, and police brutality. This book takes you to the heart of America, into the soul and circumstances of a legend that has conveyed a painful and elusive truth about our culture.</p></p><p>Cecil Brown is the author of <i>The Life and Loves of Mr. Jiveass Nigger</i> and <i>Days Without Weather</i>.

Original.</p><p>Buddhist sutras appear in anthologies, and there are collections of recent writings on Buddhism. Now Jean Smith has brought two genres together in a book that provides an outstanding look at the foundations of Buddhism. She begins sections on basic Buddhist teachings with selections from sutras or from ancient masters. She then follows them up with several commentaries on the same topic taken from the writings of present-day authorities. Across the spectrum of sects and schools, Smith draws on the collective wisdom of such respected contemporaries as Thich Nhat Hanh, Charlotte Joko Beck, Henepola Gunaratana, the Dalai Lama, and Joseph Goldstein. Buddhist teachings stress that understanding is gained by approaching single topics from a variety of viewpoints, and <i>Radiant Mind</i> provides a rare opportunity to do just that. --<i>Brian Bruya</i></p><h2>Maintenance Architecture (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>An inventive examination of a crucial but neglected aspect of architecture, by an architect writing to architects.</b></p><p>Maintenance plays a crucial role in the production and endurance of architecture, yet architects for the most part treat maintenance with indifference. The discipline of architecture values the image of the new over the lived-in, the photogenic empty and stark building over a messy and labored one. But the fact is: homes need to be cleaned and buildings and cities need to be maintained, and architecture no matter its form cannot escape from such realities. In <i>Maintenance Architecture</i>, Hilary Sample offers an inventive examination of the architectural significance of maintenance through a series of short texts and images about specific buildings, materials, and projects. Although architects have seldom choose to represent maintenance&#x2015;imagining their work only from conception to realization&#x2015;artists have long explored subjects of endurance and permanence in iconic architecture. Sample explores a range of art projects&#x2015;by artists including Gordon Matta-Clark, Jeff Wall, and Mierle Laderman Ukeles&#x2015;to recast the problem of maintenance for architecture. How might architectural design and discourse change as a building cycle expands to include &#x201c;post-occupancy&#x201d;?</p><p>Sample looks particularly at the private home, exhibition pavilion, and high-rise urban building, giving special attention to buildings constructed with novel and developing materials, technologies, and precise detailing in relation to endurance. These include Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion House (1929), the Lever House (1952), the U.S. Steel Building (1971), and the O-14 (2010). She considers the iconography of skyscrapers; maintenance workforces, both public and private; labor-saving technology and devices; and contemporary architectural projects and preservation techniques that encompass the afterlife of buildings. A selection of artworks make the usually invisible aspects of maintenance visible, from Martha Rosler's <i>Cleaning the Drapes</i> to Inigo Manglano-Ovalle's <i>The Kiss</i>.</p></p><p>Hilary Sample is a Principal at MOS, Associate Professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture Planning, and Preservation, and author of <i>Maintenance Architecture</i> (MIT Press).<p>The timing of this marvelous book couldn't be better.&nbsp;After decades of projects designed and discussed as the newest thing, we now have a study that faces the temporal reality of buildings without compromise: newness ends when inhabitation begins.&nbsp;Sample shows that the labor of construction is succeeded by the labor of remaking, of revitalization; indeed, of maintenance.&nbsp;Insofar as maintenance is a public concern&#x2015;ranging from social justice to visible beauty&#x2015;street cleaners and squeegees get their due, also works of art, and the topics that underpin current discussions of experimentation, performance, and sustainability.</p>&#x2015;<b>David Leatherbarrow</b>, Professor &amp; Chair of the Graduate Group in Architecture, University of Pennsylvania; coauthor of <i>On Weathering</i><br><br><p>To read Sample's <i>Maintenance Architecture</i> is to receive an artful set of intimate postcards from the edge of architecture's cone of vision. It is a correspondence from the architect's laboratory of reality that we ignore at our peril: maintenance will unravel our best intentions, thwart our worst, make a mockery of the sanctity of the image and its delivery of aura, and rewire the circuitry that distributes power between architect, client, and building. Poignant and thoughtful, this book argues that, in our (futile) negotiations with time and entropy, maintenance maintains the last word in architecture. Cleaning the windows will never be the same again.</p>&#x2015;<b>Francesca Hughes</b>, Architectural Association School of Architecture; author of <i>The Architecture of Error</i><br><br><p>Drawing attention to the labor and devices dedicated to the entropic battle to maintain architecture's idealized image, Sample's short and personal ruminations unravel familiar and often canonical architectural objects, re-rendering them with squeegee marks, hoover caresses, layers of dust, and the mist that passed barriers intended to control it. This book opens up a world of maintenance-intimacy to contemporary critical scrutiny and design.</p>&#x2015;<b>Ana Miljacki</b>, Associate Professor of Architecture, MIT<br><br><p>Architects are rarely trained to think about problems of maintenance, let alone care about its definition. <i>Maintenance Architecture</i> aims to quietly demolish this habit of mind. Sample's attention to the labor of cleaning, polishing, scraping, patching, and painting insists that these performances are not supplemental but essential to the preservation of architecture's image as much as its physical and social substance.</p>&#x2015;<b>Craig Buckley</b>, Assistant Professor of Modern and Contemporary Architecture, Department of the History of Art, Yale University<br><br><p>Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown said that orthodox modern buildings look like ducks. What the pair didn't say is that it is not easy being a duck; they work really hard to look calm and cool on the surface.&nbsp;Hilary Sample's stunning visual essay on the care and feeding of modern buildings makes a brilliantly compelling case for the importance of those undetected efforts. In so doing, she has also pointed the way toward an unorthodox reimagining of the history of modern architecture.</p>&#x2015;<b>Sylvia Lavin</b>, Professor, UCLA; author of <i>Form Follows Libido</i></p><h2>The Warren Buffett Way: Investment Strategies of the World&#39;s Greatest Investor</h2><p>"Simply the most important new stock book of the 1990s, to date.

Hagstrom fills in the rest of the story with some immensely practical pointers on prospering in the market." -Martin S. Fridson Managing Director Merrill Lynch "Warren Buffett is surely the Greatest Investor of this century-not so much because he built a great fortune within a free market as because he has shared his important thinking with us and has openly demonstrated the sagacity and courage so vital to success.

People are healthier, wealthier, and live longer. Yet the escapes from destitution by so many has left gaping inequalities between people and nations. In <i>The Great Escape</i>, Angus Deaton--one of the foremost experts on economic development and on poverty--tells the remarkable story of how, beginning 250 years ago, some parts of the world experienced sustained progress, opening up gaps and setting the stage for today's disproportionately unequal world. Deaton takes an in-depth look at the historical and ongoing patterns behind the health and wealth of nations, and addresses what needs to be done to help those left behind.</p><br><p> Deaton describes vast innovations and wrenching setbacks: the successes of antibiotics, pest control, vaccinations, and clean water on the one hand, and disastrous famines and the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the other. He examines the United States, a nation that has prospered but is today experiencing slower growth and increasing inequality.

The Peterson series, with nearly 50 titles, now covers everything from beetles and mushrooms to wildflowers and atmosphere, plus all manner of birding books, and fishes, too. This <i>Field Guide to Atlantic Coast Fishes of North America</i> adheres to high Peterson standards, with detailed descriptions of over 1,000 species, nearly 1,100 illustrations (420 of which are in color), and up-to-date information on range, habitat, swimming depths, water temperatures, and salinity.<p> The pictures help vastly with identification, clearly showing the differences between the spotfin hogfish and the red hogfish, the painted wrasse, Creole wrasse, and clown wrasse, not to mention the slippery Dick and puddingwife. Opposite the picture page, each fish gets a short written description, pointing out, for instance, that the Beaugregory is relatively slender and dark, with pale-centered scales, while the purple reeffish is dark blue with a bright-blue line on the upper rim of the eye. And a page number follows the thumbnail sketch, directing you to a more in-depth description of each fish, telling what it looks like when young, as well as its size and habitat range.

He is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a contributing editor to <i>The New Republic</i>, and has appeared widely in broadcast media, including <i>Dateline NBC, The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer</i>, and <i>Fresh Air</i>.In this uneven critique of mainstream and socially conscious rap and hip-hop, McWhorter (<i>Losing the Race</i>) pillories the genre for positioning itself as a political&#x2014;even revolutionary&#x2014;medium. In the author's analysis, hip-hop is typified by narcissism rather than altruism, a culture of complaint rather than creative solution and a willful blindness to the real problems affecting black communities; McWhorter demonstrates how frequently artists rail against police brutality and how few mention HIV/AIDS, the single biggest killer of African-Americans. The author's admiration for the genre generally keeps his criticisms from sounding shrill, but it cannot compensate for the book's flaws. While McWhorter lambastes rappers for failing to address real issues, he doesn't either: like the hip-hop artists he chides, the author romanticizes activism while appearing clueless about the nuts and bolts of grassroots work. Equally troubling are McWhorter's unsubstantiated theories, chief among them his claim that African-Americans are more inclined to judge a statement by how it sounds than what it communicates. More interested in skewering hip-hop than suggesting paths to substantive social change, this book ultimately frustrates more than it illuminates. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For over forty years, bioethicist cum philosopher Richard Zaner has been at the side of many of those people offering his incalculable gift of listening, and helping to lighten their burdens -- not only with his considerable skills, but with his humanity as well. </p><p>The narratives Richard Zaner shares in <i>Conversations on the Edge</i> are informed by his depth of knowledge in medicine and bioethics, but are never "clinical." A genuine and caring heart beats underneath his compassionate words. Zaner has written several books in which he tells poignant stories of patients and families he has encountered; there is no question that this is his finest.</p><p>In <i>Conversations on the Edge</i>, Zaner reveals an authentic empathy that never borders on the sentimental. Among others, he discusses Tom, a dialysis patient who finally reveals that his inability to work -- encouraged by his overprotective mother -- is the source of his hostility to treatment; Jim and Sue, young parents who must face the nightmare of letting go of their premature twins, one after the other; Mrs. Oland, whose family refuses to recognize her calm acceptance of her own death; and, in the final chapter, the author's mother, whose slow demise continues to haunt Zaner's professional and personal life.</p><p>These stories are filled with pain and joy, loneliness and hope. They are about life and death, about what happens in hospital rooms -- and that place at the edge -- when we confront mortality. It is the rarest of glimpses into the world of patients, their families, healers, and those who struggle, like Zaner, to understand.</p></p><p><p><b>Richard M. Zaner</b> is Ann Geddes Stahlman Professor Emeritus of Medical Ethics and Philosophy of Medicine, Department of Medicine, at Vanderbilt University Medical Center; and author of <i>Ethics and the Clinical Encounter</i>, and <i>Troubled Voices: Stories of Ethics and Illness</i>, among others.</p><p>"Each account enables the reader to feel the overwhelming emotions (and comprehend the immense difficulty) of choosing not to prolong life in situations where there is no hope of maintaining an acceptable quality of life." -- <i>Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries</i></p><br><br><p>"I recommend this book to fellow clinicians. It helps to hear about our work from compassionate, empathetic, thoughtful person such as Zaner. I will not quickly forget his concept of the awesome vulnerability of my patients." -- <i>Healthcare Communication Review</i></p><br><br><p>"Dr. Zaner's book is a good resource for those seeking a greater understanding of the dynamics and interplay of end-of-life events and the need to be there for vulnerable patients and their families." -- <i>The Annals of Pharmacotherapy</i></p><br><br><p>"These moving conversations and reflections place the reader squarely at the bedside, where ethical decision making is deeply situated in the agonizing dilemmas confronted by the sick. In providing extraordinary insights into the experience of patients, family members, and those involved in their care, Zaner's book is an invaluable resource for all who are interested in clinical ethics." -- <b>S. Kay Toombs</b>, author of <i>The Meaning of Illness</i> and emeritus associate professor of philosophy, Baylor University</p><br><br><p>"In an era when bioethics is increasingly defined by regulation -- writing, outcomes assessment, and the exercise of authority, we get Zaner's 'Conversations on the Edge'... a revered immersion in the nitty-gritty of medical morality, complete with the stench of wounds, the tightening grip of anguish, and the fusion of doubt and hope. Bless him!" -- <b>John Z. Sadler, MD</b>, professor and director, Undergraduate Medical Education, Department of Psychiatry, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas</p><br><br><p>"Ethical dilemmas are human problems; personal struggles over finding the right thing to do. When ethicists step into help, these problems reverberate within them as persons also. We read a lot about the ethical issues, but it takes someone of Richard Zaner's extraordinary sensitivity and superb observational skills to take us into his thoughts and inner debates to show us the personal magnitude of ethics for all the participants. This book adds a vital dimension to the study of bioethics." -- <b>Eric J. Cassell, MD, MACP</b>, clinical professor of public health, Weill Medical College of Cornell University</p><br><br><p>"Zaner has fearlessly reconceptualized ethics practice as a reflexive relatedness to others, achieved and enacted through narrative means, that opens self and other to truth. This book is a stunning accomplishment of daring, transformative, Jamesian respect for freedom." -- <b>Rita Charon</b>, professor of clinical medicine and director of the Program in Narrative Medicine, Columbia University</p><br><br><p>"Zaner's work provides emotionally moving observations and reflections on what it means 'to be' a practicing clinical ethicist: to elicit and listen; to orient and explicate; and to guide and inform. And to offer phenomenological reflections on the 'accident' of illness, the meaning of being schizophrenic or afflicted with Alzheimer's. Zaner continually reflects on his own involvements in and with those who are confronting the human tragedies of illness and death, providing insights which bear on the lives of all of us, including his own." -- <b>George Psathas</b>, emeritus professor of sociology, Boston University</p><br><br><p>"Richard Zaner's stories of life, death, love and ethics are intriguing, poignant and moving. Taken from the daily life of a big hospital, the subjects with which they deal can be raw and confronting, but the style of their telling is always warm, personal and tender. Zaner quotes Barry Lopez: 'sometimes a person needs a story more than food'. Zaner's own stories nourish, uplift and sustain. This is how clinical ethics should be practiced. Zaner's book -- a work of integrity and power -- demonstrates the complexity and richness of ethical reflection within clinical medicine. It delineates a dimension of practice that is all too often missing from both the clinic and bioethical reflection. I believe that it will establish a model and a standard for the future practice of clinical ethics." -- <b>Paul A. Komesaroff</b>, director, Monash Centre for the Study of Ethics in Medicine and Society, Monash University, Melbourne</p></p><h2>Scottish History For Dummies</h2><p>Explore the fascinating history of Scotland in an easy-to-read guide Want to discover how a small country on the edge of Northern Europe packs an almighty historical punch?

Narcotics! Nazis! Nudists! Cults! Wrestling Women! No sooner than the first movie camera was invented, it was put to sordid use. <b>Grindhouse</b> is a sexy and sardonic romp through the history of "adults only" cinema, from the roadshows and "hygiene" movies of the '30s, to the burlesque and vice movies of the '40s, to the Scandinavian Invasion of the '70s. Includes photos of rare posters and lobby cards as well as portraits of the auteurs of the films, such as Russ Meyer and David F. Friedman.Before the advent of the corner video store, connoisseurs of sex and sensation sought the stuff they loved in grindhouses. Although the low-budget films these low-rent venues screened promised more lewdness, nudity, and weirdness than they delivered, some are monuments of ludicrous filmmaking. Perhaps the best known is Ed Wood's transvestite opus, <i>Glen or Glenda</i>, but it is just one of the daffy and scuzzy movies Muller and Faris note in their decade-by-decade tour of yesterday's prurience. As historically responsible scribes, the pair recognizes the role of such big-budget, more hard-core movies as <i>Deep Throat</i> in the demise of the grindhouse genre and recounts how a film now considered a genuine classic, Tod Browning's <i>Freaks</i>, was once double-billed with classic trash like <i>Wages of Sin</i> and <i>Reefer Madness</i>. Possessed of some reference value for collocating the many titles under which the same sleazy shows were repeatedly recycled, the book's most endearing aspect may be its many illustrations--a rogue's gallery of cheesy publicity for cheesier flickers. <i>Mike Tribby</i></p><h2>The Art of Leadership</h2><p>The Art of Leadership, 6th edition, is based on two ideas: &nbsp;1. &nbsp;Leadership will take place to the extent the leader cares about the work to be done. &nbsp;Equally important, the leader must care about people. &nbsp;Neither of these qualities is sufficient without the other, and neither can be false. &nbsp;People know when the leader cares. &nbsp;When the leader is committed to the task and is concerned about people, these qualities serve as magnets and motivators to followers, and their potential for achievement becomes enormous.2. &nbsp;Leadership is an art that can be developed through mastery of nine key areas of success. &nbsp;The successful leader must possess knowledge and skills in the following areas: &nbsp;understanding leadership variables, the power of vision, the importance of ethics, the empowerment of people, leadership principles, understanding people, multiplying effectiveness, developing others, and performance management.&nbsp;<br>The difference between most other leadership texts and the Art of Leadership, 6th edition, can be compared to the difference between a lecture and seminar. &nbsp;Although both are good educational vehicles, the lecture is better for conveying large amounts of information, while the seminar is better for developing skills and attitudes. &nbsp;A good lecture is interesting and builds knowledge, while a good seminar is stimulating and builds competency. &nbsp;Without sacrificing either theoretical foundation or important content, the 6th edition of The Art of Leadership emphasizes the interactive, seminar approach to learning.&nbsp;</p><p>George Manning is professor emeritus of psychology at Northern Kentucky University.

He was blunt and outspoken about the place of jazz in music history and American culture, about which performers were the real thing (or not), and much more. These in-depth interviews, conducted several years before Mingus died, capture the composer&#x2019;s spirit and voice, revealing how he saw himself as composer and performer, how he viewed his peers and predecessors, how he created his extraordinary music, and how he looked at race. Augmented with interviews and commentary by ten close associates&#x2015;including Mingus&#x2019;s wife Sue, Teo Macero, George Wein, and Sy Johnson&#x2015;<i>Mingus Speaks</i> provides a wealth of new perspectives on the musician&#x2019;s life and career.<br><br>As a writer for <i>Playboy,</i> John F. Goodman reviewed Mingus&#x2019;s comeback concert in 1972 and went on to achieve an intimacy with the composer that brings a relaxed and candid tone to the ensuing interviews. Much of what Mingus shares shows him in a new light: his personality, his passions and sense of humor, and his thoughts on music. The conversations are wide-ranging, shedding fresh light on important milestones in Mingus&#x2019;s life such as the publication of his memoir, <i>Beneath the Underdog</i>, the famous Tijuana episodes, his relationships, and the jazz business.</p><p>"I was privileged to be a close friend of the magnetically original composer, bassist, and leader CharlesMingus, whose deeply energizing music has never left me and many, many others around the world. Mingus was singularly absorbing off the stand and now in this historic book <i>Mingus Speaks</i>, primarily a series of interviews by John Goodman, who as we see is a listener to the music burning to be a soul mate of Charles Mingus as this book proceeds.<br><br> The multidimensional inner Mingus who created what he called, not jazz&#x2015;jazz he said to me once was too limited a description&#x2015;he created what he called &#x2018;Mingus music.&#x2019; And much of the material here, in the book, has never been available before. For it so reveals and multi-dimensionally explains much of the music, and as long as there is jazz, Mingus speaks for the enthralling listeners around the world and&#x2015;and I mean this&#x2015;as they become his music.

The American welfare state is supposed to be a pale imitation of "true" welfare states in Europe and Canada. Christopher Howard argues that the American welfare state is in fact larger, more popular, and more dynamic than commonly believed. Nevertheless, poverty and inequality remain high, and this book helps explain why so much effort accomplishes so little. One important reason is that the United States is adept at creating social programs that benefit the middle and upper-middle classes, but less successful in creating programs for those who need the most help.</p><br><p> This book is unusually broad in scope, analyzing the politics of social programs that are well known (such as Social Security and welfare) and less well known but still important (such as workers' compensation, home mortgage interest deduction, and the Americans with Disabilities Act). Although it emphasizes developments in recent decades, the book ranges across the entire twentieth century to identify patterns of policymaking. Methodologically, it weaves together quantitative and qualitative approaches in order to answer fundamental questions about the politics of U.S. social policy. Ambitious and timely, <i>The Welfare State Nobody Knows</i> asks us to rethink the influence of political parties, interest groups, public opinion, federalism, policy design, and race on the American welfare state.</p></p><p>One of Choice&#39;s Outstanding Academic Titles for 2007.<p>"Forget what you thought you knew. Christopher Howard takes us on an eye-opening, mind-expanding, entirely unexpected tour of the American welfare state. He describes a big, popular, sprawling, often Republican system that--thanks to cherished American institutions like federalism--does not work very well. Smart, wise, synthetic, funny, and iconoclastic--<i>The Welfare State Nobody Knows</i> is required reading for everybody who wants to know about welfare, about politics, or about the United States."--<b>James A. Morone, author of <i>Hellfire Nation</i> and <i>The Democratic Wish</i></b></p> <p>"Christopher Howard is one of the most original and provocative students of the American welfare state--and this book splendidly sums up his insights. We learn that the American welfare state is larger and more dynamic than many have believed--yet, to this day, it fails to ameliorate inequality or poverty. Scholars and citizens alike will find that this book raises questions and provides answers nowhere else to be found."--<b>Theda Skocpol, Harvard University</b></p> <p>"Highly informative, original, and concise."--<b>Martha Derthick, University of Virginia</b></p> <p>"In <i>The Welfare State Nobody Knows</i>, Christopher Howard compellingly reveals an American welfare state that is at once larger than previously acknowledged and yet incapable of solving the fundamental social problems confronting the nation. The book, which combines narrative accounts and quantitative analysis, is up to date but historically grounded. It is also, at times, appropriately contentious. The book is a must read for anyone committed to understanding the unique character of social policy and politics in the U.S."--<b>Mark A. Peterson, UCLA School of Public Affairs</b></p> <p>"In this myth-busting book, Christopher Howard challenges cherished notions about the American welfare state--that it consists of two tiers with generous social insurance benefits for the middle class and stingy means-test benefits for the poor, that it emerged with two 'big bangs' in the 1930s and 1960s, that it is smaller than its European counterparts, and that the elderly usurp an unfair share of national resources. Beautifully written and clearly argued, <i>The Welfare State Nobody Knows</i> should be required reading for all students interested in American political development."--<b>Jill Quadagno, Florida State University</b></p> <p>"Howard provides ample food for thought-offering new perspectives on old questions, challenging prevailing stories about American social welfare policy, and sowing the seeds for more creative research and thought. The book's catchy, readable style and its attention to how to think about issues--questions to ask, data to consider, methods to use, and ways to assess our comfort or discomfort with results--engage the reader in applying the critical thinking skills that are essential to evaluating and participating in public policy."--<b>Judith Feder, Georgetown University</b></p></p><h2>Research Virtuoso: How to Find Anything You Need to Know</h2><p>Armed with this lively guidebook, students will be ready to face the often daunting prospect of conducting serious research in the information age.

Its close integration with the BlueJ&nbsp;development environment allows this book to&nbsp;focus on key aspects of object-oriented software development from day one. BlueJ's clear visualization of classes and objects means that readers can immediately appreciate the differences between them, and gain a much better understanding of the nature of an object than they&nbsp;would from simply reading source code. Unlike traditional textbooks, the chapters are not ordered by language features but by software development concepts. Language features are introduced as a response to the problems to be solved. A large number&nbsp;of different, interesting projects are used to provide variety and avoid the monotony of a running problem. This book takes an &#x201c;objects first&#x201d; approach to teaching the traditionally difficult concepts of objects in a manipulative visual form. Throughout, the emphasis is on developing a practical approach to programming, with students encouraged to add code to existing programs rather than working with an intimidating sheet of blank paper.

He was approached by a well-dressed man who told him in a quiet tone that he was going to kill himself unless the philosopher could give him a valid reason not to. Not having the time to wax philosophic on the matter, Durant did his best to furnish the man with reasons to continue his existence. Haunted by the encounter with the despondent stranger, Durant contacted 100 luminaries in the arts, politics, religion and sciences, challenging them to respond not only to the fundamental question of life&#39;s meaning (in the abstract) but also to relate how they each (in the particular) found meaning, purpose and fulfillment in their own lives. Durant turned their answers and his own into a book entitled &#34;On The Meaning Of Life&#34;, which was released to the general public in 1932. Unpromoted, the litte treasure found its way into few hands, and almost no copies of the book exist today. Now available for a new generation through Promethean Press, &#34;On The Meaning Of Life&#34; is a powerful book on a very powerful topic. In this book Will Durant has fashioned an unprecedented &#34;dream team&#34; of luminaries that is both profound and diverse: poets, philosophers, saints, inmates, athletes, Nobel Prize winners, college professors, psychologists, entertainers, musicians, authors and leaders. Within their varied insights, despite their uniqueness as individuals and the very different lives they led, the reader will note a consistent thread running through their viewpoints, revealing a commonality among human beings who not only seek meaning in life, but who actually achieve it.</p><p>Will Durant (1885 1981) was awarded the Pulitzer Prize (1968) and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1977). He spent more than fifty years writing his critically acclaimed eleven-volume series, &#34;The Story of Civilization&#34; (the later volumes written in conjunction with his wife, Ariel). A champion of human rights issues, such as the brotherhood of man and social reform, long before such issues were popular, Durant s writing still educates and entertains readers around the world.</p><h2>Du Cote De Chez Swann (French Edition)</h2><p>Used.

Daniel Stedman Jones argues that there was nothing inevitable about the victory of free-market politics. Far from being the story of the simple triumph of right-wing ideas, the neoliberal breakthrough was contingent on the economic crises of the 1970s and the acceptance of the need for new policies by the political left. This edition includes a new foreword in which the author addresses the relationship between intellectual history and the history of politics and policy.</p><p>Fascinating, important, and timely, this is a book for anyone who wants to understand the history behind the Anglo-American love affair with the free market, as well as the origins of the current economic crisis.</p></p><p><p>"Daniel Stedman Jones has an unusual talent--making the history of economic thought fascinating and significant.

He displays a willingness, unusual in a historian, to treat economic ideas seriously, and not just as weapons in a political struggle.

Like Lewis and Clark&#39;s exploration of the American West, their incredible mission revealed the mysteries of a little-known continent to a world hungry for discovery. Scaling 16,000foot mountains in the Peruvian Andes, and braving jaguars, pumas, insects, and vampire bats in the jungle, the scientists barely completed their mission. One was murdered, another perished from fever, and a third-Jean Godin-nearly died of heartbreak. At the expedition&#39;s end, Jean and his Peruvian wife, Isabel Gramesï¿½n, became stranded at opposite ends of the Amazon, victims of a tangled web of international politics. Isabel&#39;s solo journey to reunite with Jean after their calamitous twenty-year separation was so dramatic that it left all of 18th-century Europe spellbound. Her survival-unprecedented in the annals of Amazon exploration-was a testament to human endurance, female resourcefulness, and the power of devotion.Drawing on the original writings of the French mapmakers, as well as his own experience retracing Isabel&#39;s journey, acclaimed writer Robert Whitaker weaves a riveting tale rich in adventure, intrigue, and scientific achievement. Never before told, The Mapmaker&#39;s Wife is an epic love story that unfolds against the backdrop of &#34;the greatest expedition the world has ever known.&#34;</p><p>Early 18th century: A decade-long expedition to South America is launched by a team of French scientists racing to prove the circumference of the earth and to reveal the mysteries of a little-known continent to a world hungry for discovery and knowledge. From this extraordinary journey arose an unlikely love between one scientist and a beautiful Peruvian noblewoman. Victims of a tangled web of international politics, Jean Godin and Isabel Grameson&#39;s destiny would ultimately unfold in the Amazon&#39;s unforgiving jungles, and it would be Isabel&#39;s quest to reunite with Jean after a calamitous twenty-year separation that would capture the imagination of all of Enlightenment Era Europe. A remarkable testament to human endurance, female resoursefulness and enduring love, Isabel Gremeson&#39;s survival remains unprecedented in the annals of Amazon exploration.<b>Robert Whitaker</b> is a science journalist and the author, most recently, of Mad in America.

The sprawling estate, bordered by unknown territory on all four sides, is both orphanage, academy, and prison. The school has a large staff, but only five students, none of whom know what their real names are, or even how old they are.</p><p>Precocious and rebellious, all five teenagers are more than just prodigies. Amelia can see in four dimensions. Victor can control the molecular arrangement of matter. Vanity can find secret passageways where none existed before. Colin is a psychic. Quentin is a warlock.</p><p>And, as time goes by, they're starting to suspect that none of them are entirely human . . . </p><p>John C. Wright previous fantasy novels, the Epic Chronicles of Everness, were lavishly praised by both readers and reviewers. Now he embarks on an ambitious new saga that explores the overlapping boundaries of science, mythology, and the imagination.</p></p><p><p>JOHN C. WRIGHT lives in Centreville, Virginia.</p><p>I</p><p>The Boundaries</p><p>1.</p><p>The estate grounds were, at once, our home, our academy, and our prison. We were outnumbered by campus staff, and by the imposing old Georgian and Edwardian edifices. There were more mares in the stables than there were students in the classrooms. It was only the five of us.</p><p>The estate was bound to the North by the Barrows, to the West by the sea cliff, to the East by the low, gray hills of the Downs. What bound us to the South is a matter of dispute.</p><p>2.</p><p>Colin claimed the forest was the only boundary to the South. His story was that the wood had no further side, but extended forever, with the trees growing ever taller, the shade ever darker, and beasts within it ever more dangerous, huge, and savage. He said that beyond the world&#x2019;s end the trees were titanic, the darkness was from Tartarus, and the beasts were vast enough to swallow the sun and moon.</p><p>When the two of us broke into the Headmaster&#x2019;s library, I climbed up to wipe with my skirt the dust from the glass-covered map that stood above the volumes and antique folios of the oaken bookshelf. The map showed Wales to the North and Cornwall to the South. To the East were English towns famous from history and legend: Bristol and Bath, Hastings and Canterbury and Cambridge. There was London, queen of all cities. Beyond the White Cliffs of Dover was the Channel and Calais on the coast of France, gateway to the continent, to places rich and bright and beautiful and ever so far away.</p><p>Colin rolled his eyes, which were large, startlingly blue, and very expressive. "And you believe our world is the one depicted on that map?" His voice dripped silky contempt.</p><p>He ducked his head to peer up at my under-things, but scampered back when I aimed a kick at his head.</p><p>3.</p><p>Quentin, on the other hand, implied the Old Road (which ran through the forest) constituted the boundary to the South. He argued that the Straight Tracks were older than the Roman road built atop them; older than the standing stone we found among the gray hills of the Downs; older than the green mound on the South Lawn.</p><p>He spoke of ley lines, and energy paths and mysterious connections between certain hilltops, standing stones, the crumbled ruins of the tower on a rock in the bay we all called the "lighthouse." He had charts to show their alignments with various rising and setting stars on certain dates. He used an astrology chart from the back of one of Mrs. Wren&#x2019;s magazines to show, with some plane geometry, why the Straight Tracks defined the transition point between different astral domains. The argument was incomprehensible, and that made it easier to believe.</p><p>Where Colin was loud, Quentin was quiet, indrawn, unassuming. He never claimed to be a warlock, and therefore we all thought he was.</p><p>Vanity and I saw him on the Manor House roof tiles one October midnight, talking to a winged shape too large to be a crow. It took flight, and we saw its outline against the moon.</p><p>4.</p><p>Victor was more logical. He argued that the Southern boundary was the new highway B-4247, which led from the coast to Oxwich Green. This new highway was on our side of the forest, and cut through it in places. Following the highway toward the bay led to the fishing village of Abertwyi, from which the island of Worm&#x2019;s Head could be seen. Victor said the highway right-of-way followed the legal boundary as defined in the courthouse records for Shire of West Glamorgan, which listed the metes and bounds of the Estate.</p><p>We knew Victor had disappeared when the group all went to Mass one Sunday in Abertwyi-town. We did not know how he got over the stone wall surrounding the churchyard and courthouse unseen, or picked the lock on the massive iron grate, forged into fanciful shapes of leaves and black roses, which blocked the courthouse doors. Victor just was able to do things like that.</p><p>We know what he had been looking for, though. We all knew: records of our parents.</p><p>"I was naï¿½ve to expect our records to be there," he confided in me curtly. "The adoption records and genealogies only apply to men."</p><p>I cocked an eyebrow at him, and gave him an arch look. "And what about women, then?"</p><p>"The word refers to both sexes."</p><p>"Does it, really? You&#x2019;ll never talk me into going with you to the Kissing Well, if you sit there and say I look to you like a man."</p><p>"Define your terms. We are certainly human. We are certainly not Homo sapiens."</p><p>And, after a moment, he said, "Actually, I do not recall asking you about going to the Kissing Well. Your comment seems to be based on a false assumption."</p><p>Victor was, in some ways, the smartest one of the five of us. In other ways, he was just so stupid.</p><p>I should explain that, during that summer, the chapel attached to the estate had been undergoing repairs for water damage from the rains. When Mr. Glum, the groundskeeper, brought Victor, dragged by his ear, back to stand before the Headmaster, there was a consultation in the library among the Board of Trustees. The next Sunday we went to Mass in our own chapel, water-streaked walls behind the saints covered with tarp, scaffolding blocking the stained-glass windows, and everything. Further expeditions to Abertwyi were canceled.</p><p>Victor&#x2019;s argument was brief and solid. A boundary was a fiction defined by law; there were documents reciting the applicable law; and they named the new highway as the boundary. Q.E.D.</p><p>5.</p><p>Vanity was of the opinion that if we did not know where the boundary was, it could not affect us.</p><p>Her argument ran along these lines: we had been warned something bad would happen to us if we went over the boundaries, or tarried too long on the far side. But boundaries do not exist in the material world. A rock or a tree on one side or the other of an imaginary line is still a rock or a tree, is it not?</p><p>Therefore the boundaries only exist, as Vanity put it, "in our fancy."</p><p>"Think of it this way," she would say, between various ejaculations and digressions. "If everyone woke up tomorrow and agreed we should spell &#x2018;dog&#x2019; C-A-T, why, dogs would be cats as far as we could tell. But the dogs would not care what we called them. If everyone woke up and said, &#x2018;Vanity is the Queen of England!&#x2019; why, then, I&#x2019;d be the Queen of England, provided the army and the tax gatherers were among the people who said it. If only half the army said it, we&#x2019;d have a civil war."</p><p>The boundary to the South was no different. As one moved South there were trees upon the south lawn, a few, and then more, and then scattered copses, then thick copses. At some point, you would find yourself in a place with no grass underfoot, where no one had stepped before, and see trees which had never felt the bite of an axe. But where exactly was the dividing line?</p><p>The trees were thick around the servants&#x2019; quarters, the stables, and the pump house. They were thicker beyond the old brick smithy. They were thicker still beyond the even older green mound connected with local King Arthur tales; but that mound was bare of trees itself, and one came from the shadows of silent leaves into a wide round area of surprising sunlight, where four standing stones held a tilted slab high above wild grass. The stones were gray, and no moss grew on them, and no sunlight ever seemed to warm them.</p><p>Vanity said that Arthur&#x2019;s Table clearly could not be in the forest, because there were no trees there. A forest, by definition (Vanity would exclaim) was a place full of trees, wasn&#x2019;t it?</p><p>So (she would conclude triumphantly), there was no Southern boundary, provided we all agreed that there was none. What other people said amongst themselves was their own affair.</p><p>Colin would ask sarcastically, "And when they send Mr. Glum and his savage dog to hunt us down and maul us, does it then, at some point, become our affair?"</p><p>Vanity would roll her eyes and say, "If the dog mauls us on this side of the boundary, we could still say he was on the other side, couldn&#x2019;t we? Things like boundaries don&#x2019;t exist if you don&#x2019;t see them when you look for them, do they?"</p><p>"And I guess dog fangs don&#x2019;t exist if you don&#x2019;t feel it when your arm gets ripped off, right?"</p><p>"Exactly! Suppose the dog only thought he mauled us, but we did not see him nor feel him when he came to attack us! How do you know the dog hadn&#x2019;t just dreamed or imagined he attacked us? We could agree he hadn&#x2019;t done it, couldn&#x2019;t we? We could even agree the dog had agreed not to hunt us!"</p><p>Colin would respond with something like, "Why bother arguing with me? Why don&#x2019;t you just agree that I agree, so that, in your world, I have?"</p><p>Vanity would rejoin, "Because I prefer to agree that you argued and you lost, as anyone who heard the dumb things you say would agree."</p><p>Colin was not one to give up easily. "If you merely dreamed you had found a secret way out of here, that would not let you walk through a solid stone wall, would it?"</p><p>"Of course not. But no one knows which walls are solid and which are hollow because no one can see the inside of the solid ones, can they? The ones you can see inside aren&#x2019;t hollow, are they? No one else has any proof one way or another."</p><p>Vanity&#x2019;s argument was as incomprehensible as Quentin&#x2019;s, and as brief (when pared down) as Victor&#x2019;s. Apparently as long as she, Vanity, in her solipsistic purity, did not believe the Southern boundary existed, then, for all practical purposes, it would not.</p><p>6.</p><p>Vanity was short, redheaded, with a dusting of freckles on her cheeks. Her eyes were the most enormous emerald, and they sparkled. She had a little upturned snub nose I always envied just a bit. She was fair skinned and always wore a straw skimmer to keep the sun off her face.</p><p>With her lips so pale a rose color, and her eyebrows so light, I always thought she looked like a statue of fine brass, held in a furnace of flame so hot as to be invisible, so that she seemed to glow. Even when frowning, she seemed to be smiling.</p><p>She was curvy and she took wry amusement at the fact that the boys, the male teachers, even Mr. Glum, could have their gazes magnetized by her when she walked by.</p><p>I always thought Vanity was a little sweet on Colin, because she yelled at him and called him names. In the romances I read, that was a sure sign of growing affection.</p><p>As I grew older, I noticed how carefully she noticed everything Quentin did, Quentin the quiet one, and I realized she doted on him. And I began to realize Vanity actually was annoyed and exasperated by Colin.</p><p>That was when I realized, for the first time, that the five of us were not the tightly knit band of Three Musketeers Plus Two that Victor said we were, one for all and all for one, and all that.</p><p>It was not until I was around an age which, in a human being, would be between sixteen or eighteen or so, when I had the thought that with two girls and three boys, one of the boys in our merry band would end up a bachelor, or married to a stranger.</p><p>I remember where I was when this thought came to me. I was sitting on the lip of the Kissing Well, with my skirts flapping in the gusts coming from the bay, quite alone. I had just come from the infirmary, and was still seasick from Dr. Fell&#x2019;s most recent round of vaccinations. We were usually allowed to skip lessons any afternoon when Dr. Fell worked on us, provided we made up the lessons later. The well was high on a hillside, and overlooked the water. Sea mews were crying, and the sad sound lingered in the air.</p><p>It was spring, I remember, and two male birds were fighting. That was what prompted my thought.</p><p>That was also when I started wondering what my future would be. I wanted to be a pilot, an explorer. A cowgirl with a pistol. Anything that got me away from here. The idea of being a housewife seemed intolerably dull and lacking in glamour. On the other hand, the idea of never having a child was like death.</p><p>And then I said aloud to the well, "But what if they never let us go?"</p><p>The voice in the well said back softly, ". . . never let us go . .. ?"</p><p>7.</p><p>My name is Amelia Armstrong Windrose. I should say, I call myself that; my real name was lost with my parents.</p><p>We chose our own names when we were eight or ten or so. It was not until we started sneaking off the estate grounds that we realized that other children in the village were christened at birth, and kept anniversaries of their birthdays, and knew their ages.</p><p>We knew about birthdays from various readings, of course. There were references to such things from histories, where boy kings had to be killed before they ascended the throne, or from gothic romances, where girl heirs had to be wedded before they came into their majority. We knew, in a general way, what a birthday party was.</p><p>Mrs. Wren started holding them for us, with snappers and barkers and wrapped gifts, and candles on cake with icing, and toasts and games, when we complained. But her notion was to have them twice or three times a year, usually during months with no other holidays of note. And the number of candles she put on the cake could be anywhere from one to one score, depending on her mood, or the success of her shopping.</p><p>The gifts we got from her did not seem odd at the time, for we had no other basis of comparison. Once I got a wrapped roast duck, which had turned cold in the cardboard box, and lay amid its own congealed grease. Another time, a box of nails.</p><p>Colin got one of Mrs. Wren&#x2019;s shoes at that same party; Vanity got a drawer from the kitchen with knives and spoons in it. And yet, other times, her gifts were things of wonder and pleasure: a wooden rocking horse, painted fine, brave colors; a toy train set with an electric motor and a cunning little chimney that puffed real smoke; a dress of breathtaking beauty, made of a soft scarlet fabric, perhaps satin; an orb of pale crystal that glowed like a firefly when you held it in your hand and thought warm thoughts; a walking stick with a carved jackal head with silver ears, which Quentin was convinced could find buried streams and fountains underground.</p><p>One birthday party, the Headmaster simply announced we were to choose names for ourselves, and put our baby-names behind us. Only Quentin refused to choose, and kept his original name. I, who had been Secunda, used the chance to name myself after my heroine, the American aviatrix, Amelia Earhart. My family name I took from that eight-pointed star which decorates maps and determines North.</p><p>You see, I had always felt closed-in and trapped by the walls and boundaries of our estate. No matter how handsome and fine the grounds, it was still a cage to me. My dreams were for far, unguessed horizons, hidden springs of unknown rivers, un-climbed mountains shrouded in cloud. The edges of maps interested me more than the middles.</p><p>Naturally, such dreams led me to admire that breed of men who sailed those horizons, found those springs, conquered those mountains. Roald Admussen was my idol, along with Hanno, Leif Erickson, and Sir Francis Drake. My favorite books from Edgar Rice Burroughs were those where the lost city of Ophir appeared.</p><p>Amelia Earhart seemed so brave and gay, her smile so cheerful and fearless, in the one picture in the little encyclopedia entry I found of her, that only she could be my namesake.</p><p>I told myself she had not been lost at sea, but had discovered some tropic island so fair and so like Eden, that she landed her plane at once, knowing no one else would ever be daring and cunning enough to find the route she had flown. All the years that had gone by, with her still not found, seemed to confirm my theory.</p><p>My name, invented when I was perhaps a twelve-year-old, may seem silly now. But I console myself that you...</p></p><h2>The Way of Whisky: A Journey Around Japanese Whisky</h2><p><br>Since 2002 (the year it appeared on export markets) Japanese whisky has been consistently winning major international spirits awards.

Everywhere Mrs. Hawkins finds evil: with aplomb, however, she confidently sets about putting things to order, to terrible effect.</p><p>Muriel Spark (1918&#x2013;2006) was the author of dozens of novels, including The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, Memento Mori, A Far Cry from Kensington, The Girls of Slender Means, The Ballad of Peckham Rye, The Driver&#x2019;s Seat, and many more. She became Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1993.A rooming house in South Kensington and the publishing business in London following World War II are seen through the eyes of Mrs. Hawkins and told superbly by Eleanor Bron. Each character has his own idiosyncracy, and the smooth transition from one to another is never compromised. Of course, this is due mostly to Muriel Spark&#39;s ability to flesh out her characters. But Bron deserves credit as well, going from one accent to another, one voice to another, with subtle but effective changes. Her accents are authentic, and her male voices are spoken by suggestion, not by dropping to her lowest register. Hearing this story is an enjoyable experience. J.P.

I am not considered strict, but not a pushover, either. Incidentally, I am also known as the &#x201c;pretty teacher,&#x201d; which some parents (fathers and mothers alike) seem to value as much as anything else, including straight-up intelligence, a sentiment that has always confounded and vaguely annoyed me. I mean, I know I&#x2019;m not teaching quantum calculus, but I am instilling critical survival skills in children, teaching them how to add and subtract, tell time, count money, and most important, really read, unlocking the mystery of consonant combinations and abstract sounds, blended and pronounced as words, strung together in sentences, filling the pages of books, whether with or without pictures. It might seem like Groundhog Day to some, including a few of my colleagues who really need to change professions, but I am passionate about what I do, thrilled to watch things click for a new crop of children every year.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet amid the anticipation is always a melancholy feeling that the summer is over, coupled with a familiar prickling of self-doubt and anxiety that has marked all my first days of school, both as a teacher and as a student before that. I consider the many potential obstacles ahead, wondering how many of my kids will have ADHD or dyslexia or other garden-variety learning issues. Who will become frustrated or disheartened when they fall behind their peers? Which children will have impossible-to-please parents who will bombard me with emails and calls, make outlandish suggestions for our curriculum, or point out grammatical errors in my newsletters under the guise of constructive criticism? (No matter how many times I proofread my correspondence, it is inevitable that at some point during the year I will misspell a word or misplace an apostrophe, mistakes that somehow seem more egregious from a teacher than, say, a lawyer or doctor.)<br> &nbsp;<br> Then there is the disturbing matter of Edie Carlisle, the firstborn of my most significant ex, Will Carlisle. Will and I broke up years ago&#x2014;eight to be exact&#x2014;but I&#x2019;m not yet over him, at least not completely. And I simply can&#x2019;t believe that his little girl has been assigned to my class, a fact I try in vain to forget as I launch into my script, a variation of what I say every year.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Hello, boys and girls! My name is Miss Josie! I grew up right here in Atlanta and graduated from the University of Georgia. Go Dawgs! I love animals and have a rescue dog named Revis. I have one sister and a beautiful four-year-old niece named Harper. My favorite color is pink, like my sweater. My hobbies include swimming, reading, baking cookies, dancing, and playing board games. I&#x2019;m good at keeping secrets and being a trustworthy friend. I hope you will all be good friends to one another this year. I&#x2019;m so excited to get to know each and every one of you and I feel very lucky to be your teacher!</i><br> &nbsp;<br> It sounded pretty good, the exuberant delivery elevating it to a solid A, even though I could hear the annotated version in my head, which went something like this:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Every time I say &#x201c;Miss Josie&#x201d; I think it sounds like a stripper&#x2014;a job I fleetingly considered taking one summer in college because strippers make a hell of a lot more money than waitresses. And teachers, for that matter. I have a dog, and a sister named Meredith. She drives me nuts, and I would mostly avoid her altogether if it weren&#x2019;t for my niece, Harper. I used to have an older brother, but he died in a car accident a long time ago, something I don&#x2019;t like to talk about, especially to my students. I think the subject of one&#x2019;s favorite color is supremely boring because it really doesn&#x2019;t tell you much of anything (color for what&#x2014;a car or a purse or your bedroom walls?), but for some inexplicable reason, you all seem hyperfocused on it, so I&#x2019;m going to say pink because roughly half of you will be pleased with my choice and at least a third of you will marvel over the coincidence of sharing the same favorite hue. Swimming isn&#x2019;t really a hobby, just a thing I sometimes do at the Y in an attempt to keep off the weight that I&#x2019;m prone to gaining around my midsection (from all the cookies I bake, then eat), something you seem not to notice or at least not to judge. I do enjoy board games, but I&#x2019;d rather play drinking games with my friends&#x2014;or go dancing with them (did I mention I could have been a stripper fifteen pounds ago?). I can keep secrets, especially my own, which is a good thing, because if your parents knew some of my skeletons, they might send around a petition to have me fired. Friendship means everything to me because I&#x2019;m thirty-seven and can&#x2019;t find a decent man to marry, which is depressing both because I don&#x2019;t want to be alone and because I adore children more than anything else in the world. I know I&#x2019;m running out of time, at least to birth my own. Please be nice to one another this year because the one thing I will not tolerate on my watch is mean girl (or boy) escapades&#x2014;though fortunately those dynamics don&#x2019;t really kick in until next year, yet another reason to teach the first grade. I&#x2019;m so excited to get to know each and every one of you, and that includes you, Edie Carlisle. Did your father tell you that he dumped me right before he married your mother and had you? I will do my best not to hold this against you, but please show a little mercy and keep your happy-home anecdotes to a minimum.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> I smile down at their eager, shining faces and say, &#x201c;So? Do you have any questions for me?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Four hands shoot into the air, and as I consider who is the least likely to ask the one query I have come to loathe, a fidgety boy with messy hair and ruddy cheeks blurts it out: Do you have a husband?<br> &nbsp;<br> Three seconds flat. A new record. Congrats, Wesley, I think, glancing at his laminated name tag which I made over the weekend, and making a mental note to work into the curriculum that a bare left ring finger means please do not ask questions on the topic of marriage. Perhaps I could squeeze it in between our weather unit and the introduction to the metric system.<br> &nbsp;<br> I force a bigger, brighter smile, doing my best to ignore the knot in my chest. &#x201c;No, Wesley. I&#x2019;m not married. Maybe one day! And let&#x2019;s try to remember to raise our hands before we call out. Like this,&#x201d; I say, raising my hand for a visual demonstration. &#x201c;Okay?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wesley&#x2019;s head bobs up and down while I reassure myself that surely Edie knows nothing about my relationship with her father. After all, any knowledge of his romantic past would indicate inappropriate mothering&#x2014; and I&#x2019;m sure that Andrea (pronounced on-DRAY-ah) Carlisle has immaculate judgment to go along with her impeccable taste, which I&#x2019;ve gleaned from stalking her Pinterest page.

Thank God the woman&#x2019;s Instagram and Facebook profiles are set to private&#x2014;a small blessing from the social media gods.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Housekeeping</h2><p>A modern classic, Housekeeping is the story of Ruth and her younger sister, Lucille, who grow up haphazardly, first under the care of their competent grandmother, then of two comically bumbling great-aunts, and finally of Sylvie, their eccentric and remote aunt. The family house is in the small Far West town of Fingerbone set on a glacial lake, the same lake where their grandfather died in a spectacular train wreck, and their mother drove off a cliff to her death. It is a town &#34;chastened by an outsized landscape and extravagant weather, and chastened again by an awareness that the whole of human history had occurred elsewhere.&#34; Ruth and Lucille&#39;s struggle toward adulthood beautifully illuminates the price of loss and survival, and the dangerous and deep undertow of transience.</p><p><p>MARILYNNE ROBINSON is the author of the novel <i>Gilead</i> and two books of nonfiction, <i>Mother Country</i> and <i>The Death of Adam</i>. She teaches at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop.</p><br><p><b>Becket Royce </b>narrated Marilynne Robinson's <i>Housekeeping</i> for Macmillan Audio. She has also appeared on television in <i>I'll Be Home for Christmas, The Kennedys of Massachusetts, As the World Turns, One Life to Live</i>, and numerous commercials. Onstage, she has performed in New York and regionally in the plays <i>The Male Animal, Macbeth</i>, and many others.</p>1My name is Ruth. I grew up with my younger sister, Lucille, under the care of my grandmother, Mrs. Sylvia Foster, and when she died, of her sisters-in-law, Misses Lily and Nona Foster, and when they fled, of her daughter, Mrs. Sylvia Fisher. Through all these generations of elders we lived in one house, my grandmother&#x2019;s house, built for her by her husband, Edmund Foster, an employee of the railroad, who escaped this world years before I entered it. It was he who put us down in this unlikely place. He had grown up in the Middle West, in a house dug out of the ground, with windows just at earth level and just at eye level, so that from without, the house was a mere mound, no more a human stronghold than a grave, and from within, the perfect horizontality of the world in that place foreshortened the view so severely that the horizon seemed to circumscribe the sod house and nothing more. So my grandfather began to read what he could find of travel literature, journals of expeditions to the mountains of Africa, to the Alps, the Andes, the Himalayas, the Rockies. He bought a box of colors and copied a magazine lithograph of a Japanese painting of Fujiyama. He painted many more mountains, none of them identifiable, if any of them were real. They were all suave cones or mounds, single or in heaps or clusters, green, brown, or white, depending on the season, but always snowcapped, these caps being pink, white, or gold, depending on the time of day. In one large painting he had put a bell-shaped mountain in the very foreground and covered it with meticulously painted trees, each of which stood out at right angles to the ground, where it grew exactly as the nap stands out on folded plush. Every tree bore bright fruit, and showy birds nested in the boughs, and every fruit and bird was plumb with the warp in the earth. Oversized beasts, spotted and striped, could be seen running unimpeded up the right side and un-hastened down the left. Whether the genius of this painting was ignorance or fancy I never could decide.<br>One spring my grandfather quit his subterraneous house, walked to the railroad, and took a train west. He told the ticket agent that he wanted to go to the mountains, and the man arranged to have him put off here, which may not have been a malign joke, or a joke at all, since there are mountains, uncountable mountains, and where there are not mountains there are hills. The terrain on which the town itself is built is relatively level, having once belonged to the lake. It seems there was a time when the dimensions of things modified themselves, leaving a number of puzzling margins, as between the mountains as they must have been and the mountains as they are now, or between the lake as it once was and the lake as it is now. Sometimes in the spring the old lake will return. One will open a cellar door to wading boots floating tallowy soles up and planks and buckets bumping at the threshold, the stairway gone from sight after the second step. The earth will brim, the soil will become mud and then silty water, and the grass will stand in chill water to its tips. Our house was at the edge of town on a little hill, so we rarely had more than a black pool in our cellar, with a few skeletal insects skidding around on it. A narrow pond would form in the orchard, water clear as air covering grass and black leaves and fallen branches, all around it black leaves and drenched grass and fallen branches, and on it, slight as an image in an eye, sky, clouds, trees, our hovering faces and our cold hands.<br>My grandfather had a job with the railroad by the time he reached his stop. It seems he was befriended by a conductor of more than ordinary influence. The job was not an especially good one. He was a watchman, or perhaps a signalman. At any rate, he went to work at nightfall and walked around until dawn, carrying a lamp. But he was a dutiful and industrious worker, and bound to rise. In no more than a decade he was supervising the loading and unloading of livestock and freight, and in another six years he was assistant to the stationmaster. He held this post for two years, when, as he was returning from some business in Spokane, his mortal and professional careers ended in a spectacular derailment.<br>Though it was reported in newspapers as far away as Denver and St. Paul, it was not, strictly speaking, spectacular, because no one saw it happen. The disaster took place midway through a moonless night. The train, which was black and sleek and elegant, and was called the Fireball, had pulled more than halfway across the bridge when the engine nosed over toward the lake and then the rest of the train slid after it into the water like a weasel sliding off a rock. A porter and a waiter who were standing at the railing at the rear of the caboose discussing personal matters (they were distantly related) survived, but they were not really witnesses in any sense, for the equally sound reasons that the darkness was impenetrable to any eye and that they had been standing at the end of the train looking back.<br>People came down to the water&#x2019;s edge, carrying lamps. Most of them stood on the shore, where in time they built a fire. But some of the taller boys and younger men walked out on the railroad bridge with ropes and lanterns. Two or three covered themselves with black grease and tied themselves up in rope harnesses, and the others lowered them down into the water at the place where the porter and the waiter thought the train must have disappeared. After two minutes timed on a stopwatch, the ropes were pulled in again and the divers walked stiff-legged up the pilings, were freed from their ropes and wrapped in blankets. The water was perilously cold.<br>Till it was dawn the divers swung down from the bridge and walked, or were dragged, up again. A suitcase, a seat cushion, and a lettuce were all they retrieved. Some of the divers remembered pushing past debris as they swam down into the water, but the debris must have sunk again, or drifted away in the dark. By the time they stopped hoping to find passengers, there was nothing else to be saved, no relics but three, and one of them perishable. They began to speculate that this was not after all the place where the train left the bridge. There were questions about how the train would move through the water. Would it sink like a stone despite its speed, or slide like an eel despite its weight? If it did leave the tracks here, perhaps it came to rest a hundred feet ahead. Or again it might have rolled or slid when it struck bottom, since the bridge pilings were set in the crest of a chain of flooded hills, which on one side formed the wall of a broad valley (there was another chain of hills twenty miles north, some of them islands) and on the other side fell away in cliffs. Apparently these hills were the bank of still another lake, and were made of some brittle stone which had been mined by the water and fallen sheerly away. If the train had gone over on the south side (the testimony of the porter and the waiter was that it had, but by this time they were credited very little) and had slid or rolled once or twice, it might have fallen again, farther and much longer.<br>After a while some of the younger boys came out on the bridge and began to jump off, at first cautiously and then almost exuberantly, with whoops of fear. When the sun rose, clouds soaked up the light like a stain. It became colder. The sun rose higher, and the sky grew bright as tin. The surface of the lake was very still. As the boys&#x2019; feet struck the water, there was a slight sound of rupture. Fragments of transparent ice wobbled on the waves they made and, when the water was calm again, knitted themselves up like bits of a reflection. One of the boys swam out forty feet from the bridge and then down to the old lake, feeling his way down the wall, down the blind, breathless stone, headfirst, and then pushing out from the foot. But the thought of where he was suddenly terrified him, and he leaped toward the air, brushing something with his leg as he did. He reached down and put his hand on a perfectly smooth surface, parallel to the bottom, but, he thought, seven or eight feet above it. A window. The train had landed on its side. He could not reach it a second time. The water bore him up. He said only that smooth surface, of all the things he touched, was not overgrown or hovered about by a cloud of something loose, like silt. This boy was an ingenious liar, a lonely boy with a boundless desire to ingratiate himself. His story was neither believed nor disbelieved.<br>By the time he had swum back to the bridge and was pulled up and had told the men there where he had been, the water was becoming dull and opaque, like cooling wax. Shivers flew when a swimmer surfaced, and the membrane of ice that formed where the ice was torn looked new, glassy, and black. All the swimmers came in. By evening the lake there had sealed itself over.<br>This catastrophe left three new widows in Fingerbone: my grandmother, and the wives of two elderly brothers who owned a dry-goods store. These two old women had lived in Fingerbone thirty years or more, but they left, one to live with a married daughter in North Dakota and the other to find any friends or kin in Sewickley, Pennsylvania, which she had left as a bride. They said they could no longer live by the lake. They said the wind smelled of it, and they could taste it in the drinking water, and they could not abide the smell, the taste, or the sight of it. They did not wait for the memorial service and rearing of the commemorative stone, when scores of mourners and sightseers, led by three officers of the railroad, walked out on the bridge between handrails mounted for the occasion, and dropped wreaths on the ice.<br>It is true that one is always aware of the lake in Fingerbone, or the deeps of the lake, the lightless, airless waters below. When the ground is plowed in the spring, cut and laid open, what exhales from the furrows but that same, sharp, watery smell. The wind is watery, and all the pumps and creeks and ditches smell of water unalloyed by any other element. At the foundation is the old lake, which is smothered and nameless and altogether black. Then there is Fingerbone, the lake of charts and photographs, which is permeated by sunlight and sustains green life and innumerable fish, and in which one can look down in the shadow of a dock and see stony, earthy bottom, more or less as one sees dry ground. And above that, the lake that rises in the spring and turns the grass dark and coarse as reeds. And above that the water suspended in sunlight, sharp as the breath of an animal, which brims inside this circle of mountains.<br>It seems that my grandmother did not consider leaving. She had lived her whole life in Fingerbone. And though she never spoke of it, and no doubt seldom thought of it, she was a religious woman. That is to say that she conceived of life as a road down which one traveled, an easy enough road through a broad country, and that one&#x2019;s destination was there from the very beginning, a measured distance away, standing in the ordinary light like some plain house where one went in and was greeted by respectable people and was shown to a room where everything one had ever lost or put aside was gathered together, waiting. She accepted the idea that at some time she and my grandfather would meet and take up their lives again, without the worry of money, in a milder climate. She hoped that he would somehow have acquired a little more stability and common sense. With him this had so far not been an effect of age, and she distrusted the idea of transfiguration. The bitter thing about his death, since she had a house and a pension and the children were almost grown, was that it seemed to her a kind of defection, not altogether unanticipated. How many times had she waked in the morning to find him gone? And sometimes for whole days he would walk around singing to himself in a thin voice, and speak to her and his children as a very civil man would speak to strangers. And now he had vanished finally. When they were reunited, she hoped he would be changed, substantially changed, but she did not set her heart on it. Musing thus, she set out upon her widowhood, and became altogether as good a widow as she had been a wife.<br>After their father&#x2019;s death, the girls hovered around her, watched everything she did, followed her through the house, got in her way. Molly was sixteen that winter; Helen, my mother, was fifteen; and Sylvie was thirteen. When their mother sat down with her mending, they would settle themselves around her on the floor, trying to be comfortable, with their heads propped against her knees or her chair, restless as young children. They would pull fringe off the rug, pleat her hem, pummel one another sometimes, while they talked indolently about school or worked out the endless minor complaints and accusations that arose among them. After a while they would turn on the radio and start brushing Sylvie&#x2019;s hair, which was light brown and heavy and hung down to her waist. The older girls were expert at building it into pompadours with ringlets at ear and nape. Sylvie crossed her legs at the ankles and read magazines. When she got sleepy she would go off to her room and take a nap, and come down to supper with her gorgeous hair rumpled and awry. Nothing could induce vanity in her.<br>When suppertime came, they would follow their mother into the kitchen, set the table, lift the lids off the pans. And then they would sit around the table and eat together, Molly and Helen fastidious, Sylvie with milk on her lip. Even then, in the bright kitchen with white curtains screening out the dark, their mother felt them leaning toward her, looking at her face and her hands.<br>Never since they were small children had they clustered about her so, and never since then had she been so aware of the smell of their hair, their softness, breathiness, abruptness. It filled her with a strange elation, the same pleasure she had felt when any one of them, as a sucking child, had fastened her eyes on her face and reached for her other breast, her hair, her lips, hungry to touch, eager to be filled for a while and sleep.<br>She had always known a thousand ways to circle them all around with what must have seemed like grace. She knew a thousand songs. Her bread was tender and her jelly was tart, and on rainy days she made cookies and applesauce. In the summer she kept roses in a vase on the piano, huge, pungent roses, and when the blooms ripened and the petals fell, she put them in a tall Chinese jar, with cloves and thyme and sticks of cinnamon. Her children slept on starched sheets under layers of quilts, and in the morning her curtains filled with light the way sails fill with wind. Of course they pressed her and touched her as if she had just returned after an absence. Not because they were afraid she would vanish as their father had done, but because his sudden vanishing had made them aware of her.<br>When she had been married a little while, she concluded that love was half a longing of a kind that possession did nothing to mitigate. Once, while they were still childless, Edmund had found a pocket watch on the shore. The case and the crystal were undamaged, but the works were nearly consumed by rust. He opened the watch and emptied it, and where the face had been he fitted a circle of paper on which he had painted two seahorses. He gave it to her as a pendant, with a chain through it, but she hardly ever wore it because the chain was too short to allow her to look at the seahorses comfortably. She worried that it would be damaged on her belt or in her pocket. For perhaps a week she carried the watch wherever she went, even across the room, and it was not because Edmund had made it for her, or because the painting was less vivid and awkward than ...</p><h2>Angela Merkel: Europe&#39;s Most Influential Leader</h2><p>This is the fascinating tale of Angela Merkel&#x2019;s political ascent, in which she outmaneuvered her male colleagues and made Germany the strongest economy in Europe. With the storytelling gifts of a novelist, as well as nuanced political expertise garnered from over a decade of experience as an academic and journalist, Matt Qvortrup gives readers unprecedented, personal insight into Frau Merkel&#x2019;s upbringing under communism, describing how the Secret Police tried to recruit her as a spy, how she lived as a squatter in Berlin, and how she went from distributing leaflets to sitting at the Cabinet table in Helmut Kohl&#x2019;s government in less than a year. This is the story&#x2015;told for the first time in English&#x2015;of how Merkel and her staff of mostly female advisors repeatedly outsmarted the old boys network of conservative male politicians in Germany, turning her country into a more liberal and more prosperous place.&nbsp; Angela Merkel: Europe's Most Influential Leader combines the narrative of Merkel&#x2019;s life with a vivid account of German history from 1945 to the present day, featuring cameo appearances by Willy Brandt, Konrad Adenauer, and Helmut Kohl. At a time when Merkel is the chief representative of the west in the negotiations with Putin over the Ukraine, she is also the woman who holds the keys to British membership of the EU. Anyone interested in our time, in the politics of today, should read this lively account of the woman with a doctorate in quantum physics who has become the undisputed queen of Europe.</p><p>Matthew Qvortrup is currently professor of political science at Coventry University&#x2019;s Centre for Trust, Peace and Social Relations.

She must also piece together a picture of what's happening to her parents and friends at home from interrupted phone calls, censored letters, and newspaper articles. This well-written novel has a thoroughly believable protagonist and well-chosen period details. It should be noted, however, that Gonzalez portrays the single sympathetic Communist character as increasingly brainwashed. Few readers will recognize the polemics driving this convincing story, but as an introduction to the history and politics of the Cuban-exile community, it could generate some excellent classroom discussions.&#x2014;<i>Rhona Campbell, Washington, DC Public Library</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2010.

William Moraley&#x2019;s firsthand account of bound servitude provides a rare glimpse of life among the lower classes in England and the American colonies during the eighteenth century. In the decade since its original publication, Susan Klepp and Billy Smith have unearthed new information on Moraley&#x2019;s life, both before his ill-fated venture as an indentured servant from England to the &#x201c;American Plantations&#x201d; and after his return to England. This revised edition features this additional information while presenting the autobiography in a new way, offering more explicit emphasis for students and teachers in college, university, and high school about how to read and interpret Moraley&#x2019;s autobiography.</p></p><p><p>Susan E.

He has edited two other Penn State Press books: <em>Life in Early Philadelphia: Documents from the Revolutionary and Early National Periods </em>(1995) and <em>Down and Out in Early America</em> (2004).</p>This memoir, the editors argue in their insightful introductory essay, offers a contrast to the colonial-era writings of wealthy European visitors and rising successes like Benjamin Franklin. Moraley who indentured himself for money and came to the U.S. from England in 1729, spent nearly five years on the lower rungs in the American colonies. His brief, readable account, designed both to inform and entertain, is both an adventure and an ambiguous morality tale: his preface suggests a Calvinist call for individual responsibility, while elsewhere in the narrative he proclaims himself the ``Tennis-ball of Fortune.'' He is something of a scamp: while Franklin, upon arriving in Philadelphia, discovered the locals loved reading, Moraley praised the city's ``many Houses of Entertainment.'' He also describes here his childhood, his failed attempt to clerk for an attorney, his study of the watchmaking trade and his trip to the New World, where he was indentured to a clockmaker and performed diverse tasks. In America, he offers brief descriptions of geography, flora and fauna, and religious practices. As the editors note, Moraley's memoir helps fill some historical gaps; unlike him, most early travelers ignored the role of servants, slaves and Native Americans.

In this timely book he leaves his adopted home of Denmark and embarks on a journey through all five of the Nordic countries to discover who these curious tribes are, the secrets of their success, and, most intriguing of all, what they think of one another.<br> Why are the Danes so happy, despite having the highest taxes? Do the Finns really have the best education system? Are the Icelanders as feral as they sometimes appear? How are the Norwegians spending their fantastic oil wealth? And why do all of them hate the Swedes? In <i>The Almost Nearly Perfect People</i> Michael Booth explains who the Scandinavians are, how they differ and why, and what their quirks and foibles are, and he explores why these societies have become so successful and models for the world. Along the way a more nuanced, often darker picture emerges of a region plagued by taboos, characterized by suffocating parochialism, and populated by extremists of various shades. They may very well be almost nearly perfect, but it isn't easy being Scandinavian.</p></p><p><b>Michael Booth </b>is the author of five works of non-fiction, including <i>The Almost Nearly Perfect People</i>.

Gives practical advice for beginning campers... -- <i>Tuscon, AZ schools' review</i></p><h2>Shake Down the Thunder: The Creation of Notre Dame Football</h2><p>Beginning with the humble origins of the Notre Dame football program in the nineteenth century, Shake Down the Thunder traces the evolution of the team to its status as a preeminent football power - winning national championships and attracting huge crowds to its games from coast to coast. In the process, Notre Dame has been hailed as the paragon of college football, and its history has gained almost mythical proportions. This is the true story of what happened during its formative years, the reality behind the myths.<br>In writing Shake Down the Thunder, author Murray Sperber had what no other writer about Notre Dame has ever had: the use of Knute Rockne's voluminous private correspondence, which sat unopened in the university library's basement since his death. Drawing on these letters and other extraordinary archival materials, Sperber fully explores the Notre Dame sports tradition, including the background of its most famed victories and the darker side of its past. Sperber reveals the mixed stories that make up the institution's history - stories of both its unflagging devotion to high standards and its coaches' less respectable deal-making and entrepreneurial ventures. Chronicling Notre Dame's struggle as a Catholic institution in an era of rabid anti-Catholicism, this account of the rise of a college football team also reflects the changes in the country's social fabric and shows how Notre Dame's power reached beyond the field to elevate the status of Catholics in America.<br>Shake Down the Thunder introduces the real personalities behind Notre Dame's icons, illuminating individuals such as Jesse Harper, George Gipp, Father John O'Hara, Elmer Layden, Frank Leahy, and Grantland Rice, but at the heart of the book is the greatest mythic figure of them all: Knute Rockne. A national celebrity first as a player and then as a coach, Rockne established the direction of the football program in a university struggling to maintain its academic identity, and truly made the team what it is today. Sperber exposes the startling profits Rockne personally reaped from the business of college sports, the origins of the fabled Four Horsemen, and the rightful author of the "Win One for the Gipper" speech.<br>Both social history and sports history, this book documents as never before the first half-century of Notre Dame football and relates it to the rise of big-time intercollegiate athletics, the college sports reform movement, and the corrupt sporting press of the period. Shake Down the Thunder is must reading for all Fighting Irish fans, their detractors, and any reader engaged by American cultural history.</p><p><p>Murray Sperber is Professor of English and American Studies at Indiana University and author of Beer and Circuses: How Big-Time College Sports Is Crippling Undergraduate Education.</p>Sperber (English and American Studies/Indiana University; College Sports Inc., 1990) does in this exceptional, exhaustive history of Notre Dame football what he does best: dash myths and penetrate to systemic corruption and hypocrisy, all the while maintaining an implicit love for collegiate athletics. Using a cache of previously unexamined correspondence and athletic department files dated 1909-34, Sperber starts with the school's origins in the 1840's and continues through 1941. He attributes Notre Dame's football success in part to the independence it gained through its repeated rejection by the Western Conference and by the school's ``unique culture of athleticism.'' Included are fascinating anecdotes about the scheduling and playing of the great Michigan and Army games (the latter of which, contrary to legend, came about because the cadets had become ``pariahs'' by flouting standard eligibility rules); the ``Fighting Irish'' nickname, the fight song, the cheers, and the mascot; the making of the film ``Knute Rockne--All-American''; the Catholic school's battles with the KKK and other ``anti-papists''; and the corruption of journalists, officials, and coaches like ``Pop'' Warner, who frequently pocketed gate receipts. Sperber addresses what he calls Notre Dame's ``historic dilemma...the tension between its athletic prominence and its academic aspiration.'' Most telling is his look at the Knute Rockne myth. Sperber finds Rockne to be a man so concerned with ``the decline of American masculinity'' that he had no qualms about publicly humiliating those he saw as less than ``he-men.'' As the record and the testimony show, Rockne wasn't universally mourned when he died in that 1931 plane crash. His greatness as a coach, however, and as a football innovator, are given their just due here, though also placed in a realistic historical perspective. Quite an achievement: a monumental work of scholarship in both sports and social history. (Eight pages of photographs--not seen). -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Her poems are X-rays of our delusions and mistaken perceptions, explorations of violence, bad luck, fate, creeping catastrophe, love, desire, and the eros of danger, constantly exposing the fragility of the basis of trust on which modern humanity relies. They are double-edged, tense and tender, an edgy blend of irony and guts, of snarl and praise, of sharp intelligence and quizzical ambiguity.</p><p>Karen Solie was born in Moose Jaw in the province of Saskatchewan, and now lives in Toronto. She initially wanted a career as a vet but dropped that plan to pursue her writing. Her first publication, in 1995, was in a prestigious anthology, Breathing Fire: Canada&#39;s New Poets.

Not to mention sly skinny music, not to mention sheer metaphorical pounce, moves that accomplish themselves before you realise they&#39;re underway - Karen Solie&#39;s work reminds me that there is at the heart of metaphor a delicious amoral joy, that raw irrepressible humour often personified in the trickster which kicks in no matter how &#34;painful&#34; or &#34;depressing&#34; the subject&#39; - Don McKay. &#39;Solie&#39;s language is blistered, contagious; a level-eyed, machine-age ecstasy, tempered by circumstance, where &#34;Lions lie with lambs in the rusted box of a half-ton&#34;.

The photographer himself supervised the design of the book and the juxtaposition of the images. Sir Ernst Gombrich provides an introduction to the collection.</p><p>Henri Cartier-Bresson's <i>Tï¿½te ï¿½ Tï¿½te</i> contains the photographer's portraits of some of the most potent icons of the latter half of the 20th century. The book is understated, yet powerful and challenging--a masterpiece of the photographer's art of composition and expression. Presented in nonchronological order, yet arranged to provide links and parallels in posture and facial likenesses, familiar icons easily mix with anonymous subjects: a very young Truman Capote in crumpled T-shirt, on the brink of literary fame; a very old Colette, who retains her inquisitorial gaze; Matisse with his birds; Sartre with his pipe; Igor Stravinsky, astonishingly similar in 1946 and 1967; a beaming Che Guevara. There are also group portraits of unknowns, but none the less resonant for that: besuited men in 1950s Iran, tribespeople from Kashmir, prostitutes in Mexico, the women of southern Spain, dressed eternally in black. As the art historian E.H. Gombrich comments in his introduction to <i>Tï¿½te ï¿½ Tï¿½te</i>, in these portraits Cartier-Bresson moved significantly away from the received techniques of the "society" photographer. Instead, he "always preferred to lie in wait for the telling moment." <i>--Catherine Taylor, Amazon.co.uk</i>Henri Cartier-Bresson is one of this century's leading photographers and his career has profoundly influenced the field.

It also shows clearly that while you can't always choose what happens in your life, you can choose your responses, values and behaviors. The results are literally life changing and unconditionally empowering.<br><br> <i>Choosing Happiness</i> offers skills and insights across all areas of life from your most intimate relationships to parenting, your friendships, work and community. It also looks at the big questions that let you value your life and your own existence in profoundly stabilizing ways. This book is like the wise, kind friend you can return to again and again - making choices that will lift your spirits, and those of everyone around you.</p><p><b>Dr. Stephanie Dowrick </b>is the author of a number of much-loved, life-changing books. They include <i>Intimacy and Solitude</i>, <i>Forgiveness and Other Acts of Love</i>, <i>Choosing Happiness</i>,<i> Creative Journal Writing</i>,<i> Everyday Kindness</i>, and her spiritual study of visionary poet Rainer Maria Rilke, <i>In the Company of Rilke</i>. A trained psychotherapist and a spiritual leader and teacher, her award-winning writing is not only highly praised, it is also unusually accessible and supportive, uniting contemporary psychological wisdom with an effortlessly inclusive spiritual vision.In the latest from inspirational author Dowrick (Forgiveness and Other Acts of Love), she explores the seven "essentials" that can provide contentment in a world that values material success over internal fulfillment. The problem, Dowrick writes, is that people have lost track of what is genuinely rewarding: "to be kind, to live enthusiastically and creatively, to appreciate and understand experiences different from our own, and to sustain a sense of inner stability and trust even in unwelcome and difficult situations." Each chapter includes a series of mental exercises, self-examinations and meditations to explore and illuminate, in manageable steps, seven broad life skills which can seem overwhelming: "Trust who you are"; "Let your values and goals work for you"; "Choose your attitudes and responses; "Build self-respect"; "Consider others"; "Honor the people you love"; and "Think and act positively." Collaborator Greer interjects a series of questions based in concrete problems-balancing family and work, coping with guilt, forgiving oneself and others-that keep the proceedings grounded. Part self-affirmation series, part cognitive psychology and part meditation on the power of generosity, this is a thoughtful and sincere guide for those seeking to find happiness within. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

While I am loath to commit myself in writing over such a delicate matter, and dislike 'telling tales' on staff members despite their extreme lack of co-operation over the last few months, I feel the time has come to unburden myself to someone in a position of greater authority. In short, Mr Faraday, I can no longer maintain my silence. I have simply reached the end of my tether. <br><br>I appreciate that, as the 'new broom' at HO Special Services Liaison, taking over from HMCO Liaison DCI Stanley Marsden, you must have a great deal of background material to study. I shall therefore attempt to save you some work by summarising our current situation.<br><br>The Peculiar Crimes Unit was founded, along with a handful of other specialist departments, soon after the outbreak of World War II, as part of a government initiative to ease the burden on London's overstretched Metropolitan Police Force, by tackling high-profile cases which had the capacity to compound social problems in urban areas. The crimes falling within its remit were often of a politically sensitive nature, or could potentially cause social panics and general public malaise. The division's civilian counterpart at that time was the Central Therapy Unit, set up to help the bereaved and the homeless cope with the psychological stress of war. This unit closed after just eleven months because bombed-out residents continued turning to their neighbours for support rather than visiting qualified specialists. There was also, if memory serves, an experimental propaganda division called the Central Information Service (later to become the COI), which provided positive, uplifting news items to national newspapers in order to combat hearsay and harmful disinformation spread about our overseas forces, and to fill the void left by the blanket news blackouts. The PCU proved more successful than either of these, and remained in operation through the war.<br><br>I am led to believe that the title 'peculiar' was originally meant in the sense of 'particular,' as the government's plan was that the new unit should handle those cases deemed uniquely sensitive and a high risk to public morale. To head this division, several extremely young and inexperienced students were recruited. One must remember that this was a time of desperation, when most able-bodied men had been taken into the armed forces, and a great many experimental ideas were proposed by the Churchill government.<br><br>A number of successful prosecutions were brought by the Peculiar Crimes Unit in the years that followed, with the result that the unit continued its work into peacetime. The rebuilding of Britain required the suppression of those prosecutions deemed too negative for public knowledge (a fifty-year embargo being placed on sensitive war reports), and many cases handled by the PCU at this time remained <i>sub judice</i>. <br><br>In order to provide continuity, the sons and daughters of original staff members were recruited, so that the founding team was largely replaced with new employees, but two gentlemen remained in their old positions. I refer, of course, to Mr Arthur Bryant and Mr John May (see attached file 3458SD). This is where the problem starts, for both of them, despite their advanced age, are still here at the unit. They stayed on because the unit granted them a high degree of autonomy, and their specialist knowledge, plus their refusal to accept promotion, continuing instead to tackle crime at street level, won them the allegiance of young incoming staff in the Metropolitan Police Force. In years to come, as their supporters moved to positions of power, these loyalties proved useful to the detectives.<br><br>I know that the PCU has lately had some success in solving crimes that have come to the attention of the general public. I am also aware that its most senior detectives are highly respected and can offer an enormous amount of experience between them, but their manner is disruptive and their behaviour--certainly in terms of efficient, modern crime management--is unorthodox, and damaging to the image of the national policing network. <br><br>Their long-running investigation into the murders of young women committed by the so-called Leicester Square Vampire, last sighted in 1975, brought the PCU into disrepute. Their working practises proved questionable, and the case remains unsolved to this day. The unit's brief is admittedly unusual; their cases rarely provide the opportunity to follow direct leads and name suspects, but their methodology is regarded as altogether too vague, intellectual, socialist, and downright arty by those who work on the 'coal face' of crime, an image the detectives have sought to foster rather than disabuse. <br><br>Heaven knows I am no intellectual, but even I can tell that these gentlemen would be better employed as academics than as police officers. Mr May once told me that he could be loosely termed a follower of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the rational progressive who sometimes placed feeling over reason, but Mr Bryant's philosophical attitude towards criminal investigation is more complex and troubling; although enlightened and well-read, a 'cold fish' who rarely empathises with victims of crime, he is quite prepared to resort to the kind of Counter-Enlightenment mysticism that allows some rationalists to believe in ley lines and crystal healing when it suits them. Simply stated, Mr Bryant and Mr May are completely out of touch with the problems of today's youth. Elderly people rarely commit crimes; how can Mr Bryant and Mr May possibly hope to understand what is happening on the streets of London anymore?<br><br>The general public must be able to feel that their lives are in safe hands. As you know, not long ago Mr Bryant accidentally blew up his own unit. Subsequently he managed to get himself shut in a sewer, and nearly died. His partner has had one heart attack, and flagrantly defies doctor's orders to lead a less stressful working life. Nor does Mr May help our image by conducting a very public affair with a married woman. The pair keep irregular hours, behave and dress oddly, and encourage everyone else in their employ to do the same. Detective Sergeant Janice Longbright seems to model herself on Diana Dors, the fifties Rank starlet, and comes to work in the most extraordinarily provocative outfits. I sometimes wonder if we're running a police unit or an escort agency.<br><br>Neither Mr Bryant nor Mr May believes in traditional hierarchy. They speak to their colleagues as equals, and frequently ask advice from the most inexperienced members of staff. Obviously, this will not do. Mr Bryant took his exams a very long time ago, and is unwilling to entertain the idea of modern police procedure. He's always touching things; it's only luck that prevents half his cases from being thrown out of court due to cross-contamination of evidence. The criminal world has altered drastically since his time. Even constables are required to pass exams in criminal law, traffic law, and general police duties, but Mr Bryant has somehow been granted immunity from evaluation tests. He has repeatedly refused to take his Objective Structured Performance Related Examination, and deliberately falsifies results from his continuous appraisals.<br><br>Of course, the national police force now operates under a regime of openness and transparency, but Mr Bryant prefers to keep his superiors in the dark because, he says, 'it is simpler for them to understand nothing.'<br><br>As you know, my own background is in forensic sciences. When I sought promotion to a more senior decision-making role, I was brought into this unit as Acting Temporary Head. As the title implies, I did not expect to remain in the position for more than three months.<br><br>That was in 1973. I am still here, still awaiting a transfer.<br><br>By the time I joined, the Peculiar Crimes Unit had become very peculiar indeed. It could be likened to a doctors' surgery that had abandoned traditional pharmaceutical treatments for alternative therapies. Over time, these therapies have become more extreme; we have reached a point when it seems quite normal for Mr Bryant to ignore empirical data in favour of hiring a clairvoyant in the search for a missing person. Mr May is not much better; his investigation into pagan elementals a few months ago did result in the capture of a wanted criminal, but he still destroyed a section of the Regent Canal in the process, and the case appears to have involved a mass breakout of illegal immigrants from King's Cross, whom both he and his partner aided and abetted. <br><br>The bizarre behaviour of these geriatric detectives seems to infect those working around them, so that I am made to seem the 'odd man out.' I am openly ridiculed and humiliated. Mr Bryant's experiments, conducted without any safety precautions, are both questionable and dangerous. My instructions are disobeyed, my reputation has been irreversibly damaged, and my office wallpaper has been ruined.<br><br>Both Mr Bryant and Mr May are beyond statutory retirement age and show no inclination to leave. No-one seems to know quite how old they are, as their files were apparently lost in the fire that destroyed their old offices, but I am reliably informed that Mr Bryant is three years older than his counterpart. Mr May is certainly the more amenable of the pair, possessing a more youthful outlook. He is at least partially familiar with technological advances in the field of crime detection, but Mr Bryant is quite impossible to deal with. In the last eighteen months he ha...</p><h2>The Blossom Cookbook: Classic Favorites from the Restaurant That Pioneered a New Vegan Cuisine</h2><p><b>The long-awaited cookbook from the duo that brought America a new, craveable vegan cuisine, filled with over 80 recipes for upscale vegan dishes and remakes of classic comfort food fare.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Blossom has been changing the face of vegan food for more than a decade with their menus of delicious vegan meals that everyone&#x2014;both vegan and omnivore&#x2014;wants to eat.

In Lessons near-death expert Kenneth Ring extracts the pure gold of the NDE and with a beautiful balance of sound research and human insight reveals the practical wisdom held within these experiences. As Stanley Krippner states, &#34;In this remarkable book, Ring presents evidence that merely learning about the near-death experience has similar positive effects to those reported by people who actually have had near-death experiences. Kenneth Ring is one of the few authors whose gifts include the capacity to transform their readers&#39; lives.&#34;</p><p>Kenneth Ring, Ph.D. is Professor Emeritus of Psychology at the University of Connecticut and co-founder and past president of the International Association for Near-Death Studies. Regarded as the &#34;Dean of NDE Researchers,&#34; he is the founding editor of the Journal of Near-Death Studies and the author of several previous books on NDEs, including Life At Death, Heading Toward Omega, and The Omega Project, as well as the monograph, Near-Death and Out-of-Body Experiences in the Blind. Dr. Ring has appeared on hundreds of TV and radio programs, including The Larry King Show, Good Morning America, The Today Show, and many others.

Butch Karp is on the case in this exciting installment to Robert K. Tanenbaum&#x2019;s bestselling series.<br><br>When the CIA director is murdered, Butch Karp finds himself battling a heavyweight opponent: the US government. The national presidential election campaign&#x2019;s foreign policy mantra has been that the terrorists are on the run and Bin Laden is dead. There are rumors that the CIA chief was going to deviate from the administration version of events, and that the government may have had something to do with his death. Can Karp expose the cover-up and find the Chechnyan separatists who aided the Americans at the mission and who have firsthand knowledge of the terrorist attack? Karp must also find his missing daughter, who has been taken hostage by the terrorists.<br> <br>After the New York grand jury indicts the national presidential campaign chairman and the NSA spymaster for the murder of the CIA chief, Karp engages in an unforgettable courtroom confrontation with the defendants who have the full weight of the US administration, a hostile judge, and a compliant media supporting them.

After a few puffs to get the Mancuso going, he turned his attention to the enormous television mounted on the wall across the darkened room.<br> <br>Beyond the heavy drapes pulled across the windows, it was midafternoon on a sunny day in wealthy Loudoun County. But halfway around the world, it was nighttime where a Predator drone circled three thousand feet above the scene displayed in black and white infrared images on the television. Only seconds behind real time, ghostly figures of human beings showed up clearly as they ran across open spaces or ducked behind corners of a dark cluster of buildings and vehicles. Several fires also blazed away in white-hot pixels&#x2014;one clearly a truck, another on a roof&#x2014;and bursts of brilliant ellipses he knew were tracer rounds raced back and forth across the screen.<br> <br>A half hour earlier when he was rudely interrupted during an afternoon quickie with his mistress to watch the events as they unfolded, the firefight between the attackers on the outside and the besieged defenders inside the buildings had been intense. But the defenders were clearly outnumbered and outgunned; without help the outcome had been inevitable. Now almost all of the sporadic shooting was coming from the attackers, including shots apparently fired at figures lying on the ground. Executing the wounded, he guessed. Good, this is FUBAR enough already, we don&#x2019;t need any witnesses.<br> <br>&#x201c;How long ago did you say this started?&#x201d; the fat man asked. A short, neat man in black-rimmed glasses, wearing a three-piece vested suit, standing off to the side of his desk and also watching the screen, looked at his watch. &#x201c;Almost three hours ago,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;State Department got an encoded radio transmission about 1300 hours our time, 0300 Sunday there, from the compound stating that they were under attack and requesting help. State called me and scrambled an NSA drone from the airbase in Turkey. I called you after that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; the fat man said as he studied the cigar. &#x201c;Then what?&#x201d;<br> <br>The neat man pushed his glasses up his nose and looked over at a very large, hard-looking younger man sitting in a chair in a dark corner of the room watching the television intently, seemingly oblivious to their conversation. &#x201c;More calls for assistance but those stopped right before I got here. The drone was over the target and could have fired on the hostiles, but I did what you said and told them to stand down.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A necessary evil,&#x201d; the fat man replied with a shrug. &#x201c;We aren&#x2019;t supposed to be there, right? At least not doing whatever it was in the hell you were doing. We don&#x2019;t know who we would have been shooting at and that&#x2019;s not our airspace. We need to keep this under wraps if at all possible.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What about the Russians?&#x201d;<br> <br>The neat man shrugged. &#x201c;Somebody in the compound also sent a general distress call to the Russian army base near Grozny, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. um&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there was no response,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;I finally got through to the Russian embassy and told them that our &#x2018;trade mission&#x2019; in Zandaq had been attacked. One of their undersecretaries got back to me on my way over here and said that apparently the post&#x2019;s communication system had been down for repairs, but they were sending a counterterrorism team to &#x2018;investigate.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s a pretty good hop to the compound, and they won&#x2019;t be there for at least another hour and by that time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He stopped and looked at the television. There were no more signs of resistance from the buildings; some of the attackers were still running about, but others appeared to be just milling around. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s over,&#x201d; he concluded simply.<br> <br>The fat man looked at the screen. In some ways he looked like just another overweight limousine liberal; the sort who sat around in coffee shops in Birkenstock sandals over white socks and tie-dyed rock concert T-shirts while talking to their stockbrokers on their smartphones. He wore his hair, which he dyed ash blond, swept back and longish, and his well-scrubbed, hairless face with its round pink cheeks and full lips looked almost boyish. He was sixty years old and with the toadying press liked coming off as an affable political geek holdover from the late sixties. But he was shrewd, ruthless, and committed to his far left of center politics, and right now, his weak blue eyes glinted with anger behind the round wire-rim glasses he wore.<br> <br>&#x201c;It may be over in fucking Chechnya,&#x201d; he growled as he stabbed his cigar at the screen, &#x201c;but it&#x2019;s not fucking over here. In fact, the shitstorm hasn&#x2019;t even started here, but it will if we don&#x2019;t keep a lid on this and know what we&#x2019;re going to do to distract the voters if anything does get out.&#x201d; He took a long drag and blew the smoke at the ceiling. &#x201c;So tell me again what the fuck we were doing there?&#x201d;<br> <br>The neat man, Tucker Lindsey, cleared his throat. He didn&#x2019;t like the fat man, detested him as a matter of fact. A crude, obese, arrogant asshole from the Midwest, he&#x2019;d described him to his former colleagues at the State Department. Certainly not a member of &#x201c;The Club&#x201d; that permeated the entourage around the president, as well as his cabinet and appointed posts, particularly at State. Not an Ivy League man, he thought with disdain.<br> <br>In a world that made any sense, there would have been no way that he, a Harvard Law grad and the president&#x2019;s national security adviser, should have to answer to the boorish tub of goo. But Rod Fauhomme was the president&#x2019;s re-election campaign manager, probably the best in his dirty business, and with the election only three weeks away, orders from the top were that the corpulent politico was calling the shots on anything that might affect the president&#x2019;s run at a second term.<br> <br>&#x201c;Officially, it&#x2019;s a trade mission,&#x201d; Lindsey said. &#x201c;A deputy chief of mission from the U.S. consulate in Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, reaching out to the locals. In reality, DCM David Huff and a small security detail drove to Zandaq, a small, out-of-the-way town in southeastern Chechnya, to meet with one of the leaders of the Chechen separatist movement.&#x201d; He nodded at the television screen. &#x201c;What you&#x2019;re looking at there is a small gated compound about five miles from town that we lease as part of an agricultural and cultural outreach program run by State.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And why are we meeting with this Chechen separatist?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;To work out a quid pro quo deal,&#x201d; Lindsey said. &#x201c;He helps us get arms to the rebels in Syria; in exchange he keeps some to get rid of foreign fighters&#x2014;mostly Islamic extremists&#x2014;and the Russians; we also agree to support their bid for independence from Russia at the United Nations.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do we care about their independence?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;To some extent where it meets our foreign policy goals; but it&#x2019;s a dangerous world out there, a constant juggling act. These Chechen separatists are Muslim but they&#x2019;re secular and moderate; they&#x2019;re a better counterbalance to extremist Islamic states than any government we could have created on our own. Plus they hate the Russians with a passion, and anything that distracts the Kremlin can&#x2019;t be all bad.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not just give the guns to the Syrian rebels openly? Everybody knows we want Assad out of there; nobody likes the guy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Again, Lindsey shrugged. &#x201c;The usual walking a tightrope when it comes to the Middle East. We don&#x2019;t want to be seen as toppling yet another government in a Muslim country. And if the weapons wind up in the wrong hands after Assad&#x2019;s out&#x2014;i.e., killing U.S. soldiers in some other place or bringing down an airliner in Munich&#x2014;we need to be able to deny it was the administration.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then why Chechens? Why not just tell the Israelis to do it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Israelis have the same concern about where the arms will eventually wind up and also don&#x2019;t want them being traced back to them. Imagine how it would go over in Tehran or Cairo if the Arab press got wind of the Israelis&#x2019; providing arms to rebels to topple Muslim governments.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To be honest, we&#x2019;re also yanking the Russians&#x2019; chain a little bit. They&#x2019;re not helping us out with Syria, or with the damn Iranians, so we&#x2019;re stirring the pot in their backyard.&#x201d;<br> <br>Fauhomme shook his head. &#x201c;Jesus, don&#x2019;t you spooks ever get tired of &#x2018;stirring the pot&#x2019;? It never seems to pan out, or is Iran-Contra such a distant memory that the lesson has been forgotten?&#x201d;<br> <br>Stung, Lindsey countered. &#x201c;No more than you get tired of manipulating voters.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Fauhomme snorted. &#x201c;But I get results.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No offense,&#x201d; Lindsey replied tersely, &#x201c;but you have no idea what has worked and what hasn&#x2019;t. All you hear about is the occasional foul-up that is bound to happen now and again, but believe it or not, we have reasons for doing what we do that might not be apparent to someone who isn&#x2019;t in the loop.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lindsey made his last comment pointedly, but Fauhomme just brushed it off with a wave of his cigar. &#x201c;If I want in the loop, I&#x2019;ll get in the loop,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;But we have experts, like yourself, to muck it up just fine on your own.&#x201d;<br> <br>The fat man rubbed his face with his pudgy fingers. He had been in the political game for most of his adult life. The son of an auto worker and avowed communist, he&#x2019;d joined Students for a Democratic Society when he arrived on a college campus in Illinois in the late sixties. But when the SDS wasn&#x2019;t radical enough in its plans to topple the Establishment, he&#x2019;d signed on with the violent Weathermen faction, hoping to plant bombs and kill cops.<br> <br>However, times changed and he and his fellow &#x201c;revolutionaries&#x201d; decided that they would have a better chance of bringing down the corrupt capitalist system if they worked insidiously from the inside. So he turned to the political party most closely aligned with his politics, even though the party leadership was far too close to the middle and away from the left for his tastes. Then he made a name for himself as a &#x201c;community organizer.&#x201d; That was where he&#x2019;d met the president, a kindred spirit, and a few years later ran his first political campaign for alderman.<br> <br>Fauhomme had gone on to run other campaigns for candidates who fit his left-wing profile, but always dropped whatever else he was doing if the then-future president called asking for help as he climbed the ladder from state to federal offices. He was a true believer, and what he believed in was a socialist America, whether its population chose to identify itself that way or not. The men and women he helped elect were those he thought would push the United States further to the left with every election cycle.<br> <br>Over the past few years, it had helped that the opposition party seemed bent on self-destruction, trotting out pathetic candidates who seemed to relish snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. It went hand-in-hand with his favorite campaign ploy, which was to attack the candidate on a personal level and avoid talking about the real issues whenever possible. With the economy in shambles, two foreign wars, and massive debt, the opposition should have run away with the upcoming election. But instead, the other party selected a candidate who fit the stereotype Fauhomme himself had worked to convince the low-information masses was their biggest enemy&#x2014;wealthy, out of touch with working people, and part of the good old white boys&#x2019; club that was &#x201c;holding them back&#x201d; and unfairly hoarding all the wealth. Toss in a few Neanderthal candidates to spew insults at minorities and women&#x2014;which the opposition party had not countered successfully while Fauhomme, with the help of a willing media, used to paint the entire party with the same broad &#x201c;mean-spirited&#x201d; brush&#x2014;and that runaway victory was instead a double-digit lead in the polls for the president.<br> <br>Still, not everyone in the country was buying the bullshit he was spreading. Many were paying attention to a stagnant economy, trillion-dollar deficits, runaway entitlement programs, the haphazard and dangerous foreign policy, and a steady encroachment on rights and traditional values. Not everyone believed that the government could spend its way out of a deep recession or trusted the manipulated employment numbers. Thus the election was not a shoo-in for Fauhomme&#x2019;s man either.<br> <br>In fact, three weeks earlier, the normally wooden opposition candidate had delivered a surprisingly passionate performance in the first debate that had centered on the economy and had the president up against the ropes by its end. The drubbing had shown up immediately in the polls with the opposition closing that double-digit lead to mid-single digit. Reeling from the disaster, Fauhomme immediately fired the team appointed to prepare the president for the debate, even though the real problem had been the candidate&#x2019;s arrogance.<br> <br>As a result, two nights earlier the president had rebounded with a strong showing in the second debate, which had centered on foreign policy and terrorism. For reasons even Fauhomme couldn&#x2019;t fathom, the opposition candidate backed off attacking the weaknesses in the president&#x2019;s policies, saying that &#x201c;in these dangerous times, we need to come together and present a united front to America&#x2019;s enemies.&#x201d; Bullshit, he&#x2019;d thought when he heard that, you are the enemy.<br> <br>The president&#x2019;s performance had for the moment stopped the opposition&#x2019;s momentum, but the losses in the polls had not been regained. The one thing the campaign did not need now was a debacle like the one playing out on the television screen.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, so we&#x2019;re playing games with the Russians and trying to clandestinely get weapons into the hands of God-knows-who to get rid of Assad, probably in violation of U.S. and maybe even international law&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. business as usual for you national &#x2018;insecurity&#x2019; types, I get it,&#x201d; Fauhomme said. &#x201c;But I got an election hanging in the balance, and if we lose, not only is it over for the president, it&#x2019;s over for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>He let his warning sink in as he stared at Lindsey until the little man looked away. He smiled slightly and stole a glance at the younger man in the corner, a former Marine named &#x201c;Big Ray&#x201d; Baum who&#x2019;d been drummed out of the Corps for brutal acts against civilians in Afghanistan. Baum was smirking, having listened to the exchange.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you think the Russians could be behind the attack?&#x201d; he asked, turning back to Lindsey.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t put it past them. The attack looked pretty organized, but some of it was haphazard and took a long time considering their superior numbers and firepower, not the discipline you&#x2019;d expect to see from Russian special forces masquerading as insurgents. But the Russians certainly wouldn&#x2019;t have been happy if they found out what our &#x2018;trade mission&#x2019; was really about and could have got someone else to do their dirty work for them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So what will they do now after their &#x2018;investigation&#x2019; turns up dead Americans?&#x201d; Fauhomme asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll blame it on the separatists,&#x201d; Lindsey replied. &#x201c;The more they can link the separatists with terrorism, the more they can crack down on the movement. Officially we&#x2019;d have to go along with it; we don&#x2019;t say anything about the brutal ...</p><h2>C.N. Bialik: Selected Poems (Jewish Classics)</h2><p>More than 60 years after his death, Chaim Nachman Bialik is inevitably called the finest and most influential modern Hebrew poet. Hailed as the poet laureate of Jewish nationalism, he was seen as the poet of hope and revival in an age that witnessed the Russian Pale of Settlement, pogroms, the Russian Revolution, and the rise of Zionism. Bialik's legacy is poetry that inspires, astonishes, and delights, and David Aberbach, the distinguished Hebrew scholar, has produced translations of a high order to stand beside the author's original Hebrew. <br><br> Edited and translated by David Aberbach.</p><p><p>David Aberbach is Associate Professor of Hebrew and Comparative Literature at McGill University and Visiting Academic at the London School of Economics.

Evildoers jostle for position, including the likes of Basil the Bulgar-slayer, Vlad the Impaler, Heinrich Himmler, Pol Pot, Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, Nicolae Ceausescu, and Slobodan Milosevic. Many common threads appear, including brutalized childhoods, an unswerving will to power, and often the support, tacit or otherwise, of a legion of willing accomplices. There are many contrasts, too. Some are charismatic leaders with forceful personalities, while others acted alone and in secret, solitary narcissists, full of self-loathing and repressed desire.For those who are fascinated by what makes men evil, violent, and monstrous, 101 People You Won't Meet in Heaven is an engrossing and honest examination of humankind's baser instincts.<b>Michael Powell</b> is a freelance writer who has penned more than fifty titles, from historical guides to historical compilations.

Unlike other anthologies that usually organize their contents according to tale type, motif, or country of origin, the richly diverse collection edited by Christine A. Jones and Jennifer Schacker presents fairy tales in chronological order, thus creating an illuminating timeline that stretches from the 2nd century BCE to the end of the first decade of the 21st century. Envisioned as a &#x2018;journey through fairy tale history,&#x2019; <em>Marvelous Transformations</em> is full of pleasant surprises in the form of obscure and rarely anthologized texts, little known writers/collectors, and a series of brand new essays penned by some of the most prominent fairy tale scholars.&#x201d; &#x2015; Nada Kujund&#x17e;ic, <em>International Research Society for Children&#x2019;s Literature</em> </p> <p> &#x201c;Christine Jones and Jennifer Schacker have created an unusual and fascinating anthology dedicated to the study of folklore and fairy tales. Instead of collecting a variety of tales from a particular country or from different parts of the world, they have assembled international texts chronologically, from earlier written traditions to contemporary transcriptions and translations. They have also included brief commentaries and essays on important topics. Their aim is to foster an interdisciplinary and historical approach to understanding the complex evolution of a genre, and it is to their great credit that they have produced a most original book that will be useful to readers who seek to grasp the mysterious changes that fairy tales have undergone ever since once upon a time.&#x201d; &#x2015; Jack Zipes, Professor Emeritus, University of Minnesota </p> <p> &#x201c;We may think we know what fairy tales are and what they mean, but the stories and critical essays collected by Christine Jones and Jennifer Schacker succeed in making the seemingly familiar decidedly unfamiliar. <em>Marvelous Transformations</em> invites readers to discover fairy tales both well known and neglected and, at the end of the volume, a series of short essays that bring together the best of current literary and folkloric approaches to the genre. Students, teachers, scholars&#x2015;indeed, all readers interested in fairy tales&#x2015;have much to learn from this volume.&#x201d; &#x2015; Lewis Seifert, Brown University </p> <p> &#x201c;This volume&#x2019;s strength lies in both its range of primary source stories and the span of secondary criticism included. With their selection of texts, Jones and Schacker have also attempted to situate fairy tale studies in a broader interdisciplinary context that emphasizes the relationship between literary history and folklore history, particularly field-based oral storytelling.&#x201d; &#x2015; Johanna Denzin, Columbia College </p> <p> &#x201c;Jones&#x2019;s and Schacker&#x2019;s Marvelous Transformations is not simply another fairytale collection but a true contribution to scholarship and a powerful statement on the future of fairytale studies. In weaving together tales from around the world and scholarship from a variety of disciplines, the editors make a strong case for a fresh look at the fairytale form. While I highly recommend this book overall, I especially recommend it for use in classrooms: it demonstrates the diversity, beauty, and endurance of fairy tales and should be a delightful surprise to undergraduates who come in thinking fairy tales are all the sugarcoated Disney stories they remember from when they were small. I am certain that I too will refer back to this text again and again.&#x201d; &#x2015; Brittany Warman, <em>Journal of Folklore Research</em> </p></p><h2>First World War</h2><p>If almost every war is worse than expected, none was more so than World War I. Instead of lasting a few months, its four years brought loss of life and enormous suffering millions. It caused the collapse of empires and redrew the map of Europe for ever. Illusions on all sides - military, political and cultural were shattered. This book charts the ever-growing development and horror of the war - not only the great battles on the Eastern and Western Fronts but the war at sea, in the air and the effects of the war far from the frontline. Throughout, the book records the courage and heroism of individual soldiers and civilians of many nations in this account of the Great War.</p><p>Martin Gilbert was born in London in 1936 and educated at Highgate School and Magdalen College, Oxford. In 1962, he became research assistant to Randolph Churchill and, after Randolph&#39;s death, succeeded him as biographer of Sir Winston Churchill. He is the author of many works of history and lives in London and Jerusalem.There may be no event in this century that has been more written about than the First World War. There may be little new to uncover about it. But this splendid book shows that its lessons cannot be too often learned. This is by no means a complete history. Whole areas of the conflict are scanted or mentioned only in passing, in particular the war on the Eastern Front. Distinguished British historian Gilbert (The Second World War, 1989, etc.) gives a great deal of attention to the British, less to the French, and a good deal less to everyone else. Nor is he particularly interested in strategy. But the power and passion that he brings to the story, the vividness with which he recreates the scale of the conflict, the enormity of its suffering, feats of individual bravery and cowardice, of devotion and desertion, will be hard to emulate. What lingers in the mind is the sheer scale of the suffering. In the first five weeks of conflict at Verdun, German soldiers were killed at the rate of one every 45 seconds, and French death rates were even higher. In the five months during which the battles of Verdun and the Somme were waged in 1916, nearly a million men died, an average of 6,600 every day, more than 277 every minute, nearly 5 every second. This was not exceptional: As Gilbert points out, the 20,000 British soldiers killed on the first day of the Somme are often recalled with horror, yet on average, a similar number of soldiers died during every four-day period of the entire war. His searing descriptions of the carnage poignantly remind us of the terrible consequences that followed from the casualness with which European statesmen allowed their nations to drift into war. An incomparable record of how ordinary and extraordinary men and women endured the unendurable. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Increasingly popular perennials, cannas are perfect for today&#39;s flamboyant, tropical-style garden trends.Cannas are among nature's exhibitionists. Their large, lush leaves are accompanied by flamboyant blooms for a long period over summer. To the gardener in cooler countries, the plants look impossibly exotic, as if they would wilt at the merest hint of a fresh breeze. However, cannas are capable of flowering prolifically in temperate climates and, although usually lifted for frost-free winter storage, will even survive outside all year round in mild areas. Their strong forms and eye-catching colors make them perfect for planting in small numbers as focal points or in bigger groups to create a subtropical ambience. Best known for their brighter hues, there are also plenty of cannas in subtle tones for a more refined effect.<p> In <i>The Gardener's Guide to Growing Cannas</i>, Ian Cooke describes just how easy it is to grow and propagate these plants.

As a fan myself, this is the kind of stuff I eat up and I'm sure the many devotees of the graphic novel will do the same!" says Gibbons.<br><br>ï¿½ DC Comics 2008. All Rights Reserved. <br> <br> <strong>A Q&amp;A with Dave Gibbons on the Making of <em>Watchmen</em></strong> <br> <p></p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> You were tasked with drawing new illustrations of key shots from the new <em>Watchmen</em> film. Was it a difficult challenge to re-imagine your work in this movie format?</p> <p><strong>Dave Gibbons:</strong> I don&#x2019;t think that I actually did many key shots from the film. I had to actually imagine them rather than exactly recreate what was going to be in the movie. But as far as the drawings I did for the licensing purposes, accuracy was the real key so that they looked exactly like the movie. Whereas doing the graphic novel was creating stuff afresh and being very creative, this was more the case of interpreting something that already existed. So it was rather more a commercial art job than a creative thing.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How many scenes from the original graphic novel did you redraw in the new "movie" format?</p> <p><strong>DG:</strong> I kind of did them piecemeal, these licensing drawings. I did do a section of storyboarding for Zack Snyder. There is a part of the movie that isn&#x2019;t in the graphic novel and he wanted to see how I would have drawn it, if it had been in the graphic novel. So I redid the storyboards as three pages of comic on the nine-panel grid, also getting it coloured by John Higgins so it looked authentic. But I think there were probably only 3 or 4 scenes that I drew, which were from the movie.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What was your working method for producing these new illustrations from the film? And how has it changed from when you originally illustrated <em>Watchmen</em>?</p> <p><strong>DG:</strong> When you&#x2019;re producing things from existing material, you have to look at and assemble the references... you know, keep looking backwards and forwards to make sure what you&#x2019;re drawing is accurate to what&#x2019;s in the photos. I did have lots of photos from the movie and in some cases I had more or less the illustration I was going to do in photo form, which made it a lot easier. On others I had to construct it from various references: really just the usual illustrator&#x2019;s job of drawing something to reference. And on the original illustrations of <em>Watchmen</em>, I was free to come up with exactly the angles and exactly the costumes and everything that I wanted to. When you&#x2019;ve designed a costume and drawn it a few times, you actually internalize it and you find you can draw it without having to refer to reference at all. So in some ways it&#x2019;s more creative and in some ways it&#x2019;s easier!</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> In <em>Watchmen: The Art of the Film</em>, there are concept designs by other artists of their visions of your iconic characters. What do you think of their versions and did you offer any guidance while they were working on these?</p> <p><strong>DG:</strong> It&#x2019;s always really interesting to see versions of your characters drawn by other artists. You tend to see things in them that you hadn&#x2019;t noticed before. So I really enjoyed looking at those. I certainly didn&#x2019;t offer them any guidance. The purpose of getting those kinds of drawings done is to get a fresh perspective on what exists. I noticed actually that they really stuck more closely to my original designs than those, but I really enjoyed seeing them.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Watchmen: Portraits</em> is Clay Enos&#x2019;s stunning black and white collection of photos of each character from the <em>Watchmen</em> movie. What was it like looking through this book at all the characters you had conceived years ago now being brought to life by actors?</p> <p><strong>DG:</strong> It&#x2019;s rather interesting; you know if you look at the <em>Watching the Watchmen</em> book you can see these characters as fairly sketchy rough conceptual versions. Then when you look at Clay&#x2019;s book you can actually see them right down to counting the number of pores on the skin on the end of their noses! It&#x2019;s incredible high focus! It&#x2019;s like zooming in through space and time to look at the surface of some moon of Saturn or something. I thoroughly enjoyed his book... it had a real artistic quality to it that was really so good. And of course to see these actors who so much are the embodiment of what I drew, that it&#x2019;s a tremendous thrill to see them made flesh!</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Watchmen: The Film Companion</em> features some stills from the animated version of <em>The Black Freighter</em>. What do you think of the look and design of this animated feature?</p> <p><strong>DG:</strong> It looks really interesting! Although I drew my version in the comic book in a kind of horror-comic style, these are very much in a savage manga style. I think they work really well... they&#x2019;ve got the kind of manic intensity, which I think that work should have and I really can&#x2019;t wait to see the whole feature. I&#x2019;ve seen the trailer for it and that looks great and again they&#x2019;ve used a lot of the compositions that I came up with but just translated them to this kind of very modern drawn animation.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How much time did you spend on the set of <em>Watchmen</em>? Was it a surreal experience to see your work recreated like this?</p> <p><strong>DG:</strong> I was on the set of <em>Watchmen</em> for a couple of days and it really was surreal to walk through a door and then suddenly be in the presence of all these people in living breathing flesh! I was there for what you would call the Crimebusters meeting where they were all there in costume in the same room, which was incredible. They had obviously planned that so I would get to see everyone. It was surreal though quite a wonderful experience to see it come to life.</p><b>Dave Gibbons </b>is best known for his iconic artwork on the groundbreaking graphic novel <i>Watchmen</i>.

Combining useful information on important anatomical features with direction on how to handle the subjects and how to express their forms and postures, the author has produced a complete, inexpensive, at-home course in animal painting and anatomy.<br>All aspects of animal drawing and painting are covered: drawing from life; anatomy in relation to drawing (not surgical anatomy, but a precise knowledge of the visible structure and movements of animals); characteristic movements of animals and suggestions on how to capture them in your picture; composition (design, restraint, rhythm, balance of light and shade, relative scale of animals and landscape, foregrounds); painting and color. 36 illustrations, mostly sketches by the author, depict horses, pigs, cows, dogs, and other animals in various life positions and movements. A long, detailed discussion of the anatomy of animals completes the book. Here Mr. Calderon describes all the structures of animals that are of significance to the artist: the vertebral skeleton, the bones and muscles of the head, the muscles of the vertebral skeleton, the fore-limb and its muscles, the muscles attaching the shoulder blade to the trunk, and the bones and muscles of the hind limb. 208 drawings accompany these discussions and show you how anatomy is related to surface contours and techniques of shading. <br></p><p></p><h2>The Weightlifting Encyclopedia: A Guide to World Class Performance</h2><p>This book is in very good condition, it just has highlighting on some of the pages and some very slight wear on the edges of the front cover.</p><p><i>The Weightlifting Encyclopedia</i> Lifting weights is one of the most popular and fastest-growing athletic activities in the world today.

Ben Green, World Masters Champion, Coach of 3 Olympians and Co-coach of 2 Senior National Champion Teams </p><p>The author has been an international level athlete, coach, and official in the sport of weightlifting. He was the last male from the USA to set a world record in weightlifting recognized by the International Weightlifting Federation.</p>Having been an international-level athlete, coach and judge, Arthur Drechsler brings a wealth of experience and love to this book. Is it possible that too much love and experience went into this book? At over 400,000 words it's tempting to think so,but the book's depth of coverage isn't a fault. It's the text's development and execution that are suspect here. The book is "encyclopedic," but only in the sense that it attempts to cover every aspect of the sport of Olympic-style weightlifting (It does not run through an alphabetized list of concepts and terms.).The editors at A is A, in their zeal to publish an "instant classic" (their own Words), failed to reign in Drechsler's prose (a good copyeditor should have lost 10,000 words) or focus Drechsler on one task (he could have written an encyclopedia and a training guide). Instead, the segment of the audience looking for a reference has to do a lot of sifting to get at the nuggets of information they want (the index helps), and those looking for a training guide would be better served to look elsewhere. This is not a gym-friendly book. Its bulk and poor design make it an unuseful practical tool, with less than adequately illustrated exercises and techniques scattered throughout the text.Yet despite these flaws, this book demands attention from all those serious about the sport. Drechsler's sheer determination toward thoroughness drives this work. In Drechsler's voice dedicated athletes will find an advocate that they may value; coaches and strength training professionals will find a force that they must reckon with. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i></p><h2>The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind</h2><p>The scandal of the evangelical mind is that there is not much of an evangelical mind. So begins this award-winning intellectual history and critique of the evangelical movement by one of evangelicalisms most respected historians. Unsparing in his judgment, Mark Noll ask why the largest single group of religious Americans, who enjoy increasing wealth, status, and political influence, have contributed so liutle to rigorous intellectual scholarship in North America. In nourishing believers in the simple truths of the gospel, why have evangelicals failed at sustaining a serious intellectual life and abandoned the universities, the arts, and other realms of high culture? Noll is probing and forthright in his analysis of how this situation came about, but he doesnt end there. Challenging the evangelical community, he sets out to find, within evangelicalism itself, resources for turning the situation around.</p><p><i>The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind</i>, by Mark Noll, is "an epistle from a wounded lover." Noll loves God and he loves academics, but he is wounded because many of his colleagues deny the possibility of maintaining the integrity of both loves. Noll's epistle is a memoir, a historical study, and a wide-ranging piece of cultural criticism that argues, "The scandal of the evangelical mind is that there is not much of an evangelical mind." Noll considers the effects of evangelical intellectual atrophy on American politics, science, and the arts, and he ultimately offers wise and practical advice for readers who want to explore the full intellectual implications of the incarnation of Christ. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Mark A.

Stavis has cleansed thousands of tormented people, from small children and Hollywood moguls to stay-at-home moms and politicians. But for many years, the horror screenwriter and novelist denied her gift. As a little girl, she began to see "monsters" floating around her bedroom or attached to other children. Told it was only her imagination, Rachel learned to ignore the things she saw. </p><p>But a series of events in adulthood forced her to acknowledge her unique ability and embrace her power to heal. Since then, Rachel has dedicated her life to helping others cast off the forces feeding off of us. Performing her services pro-bono, she quietly worked in the shadows, until she unknowingly revealed her work to a journalist, who told her story to NPR.</p><p>A unique look at demonology removed from religious dogma, <em>Sister of Darkness</em> recounts Rachel&#x2019;s journey to becoming an exorcist and chronicles some of her most extreme cleansings cases, including those that put her and her clients in peril. Going deep into her world, we meet the diverse range of people she has helped&#x2014;young, old, famous and not&#x2014;in gripping stories of danger and sometimes sadness, that are ultimately about redemption. Rachel teaches us that there are a diverse range of "entities" surrounding us&#x2014;some of these are playful or misguided, while some are dangerous and harmful. She introduces each of them and explains their power, helping us understand what is attacking and hurting us, and what we can do to protect ourselves.</p><p>Frightening, eye-opening, and utterly enthralling, <em>Sister of Darkness</em> brings to light a world ruled by destruction, chaos and fear, and the woman who bravely fights to protect&nbsp;those who seeks her out.</p></p><p><p><strong>One woman alone&nbsp;has the power to destroy our demons</strong></p><p>We&nbsp;may not be able to see them, but they&#x2019;re always there. Smoke and shadows, ghoulish features or lifelike forms, there are the demons, or what Rachel Stavis calls &#x201c;entities,&#x201d; that float around us, or even attach themselves to our bodies, feeding off our fears and our negative energy. As the world&#x2019;s only nondenominational exorcist, Rachel has found herself at the crux of the spiritual crossroads of thousands of clients&#x2014;all of whom she&#x2019;s been able to save by ridding them of their spiritual baggage, and getting at the root causes of their low frequency at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p>Stavis realized her gift as young child, but for years she pushed it away, wishing for it to disappear as her mother dismissed it as a call for attention, the lies of a schoolgirl. After years of denying her gift for communicating with the spirit world, she fearlessly turned what she once regarded as a curse into a blessing to help those in need. Stavis has cleansed thousands of tormented people, from small children to musicians, politicians, and everyone in between, quietly performing her work in obscurity, until now.&nbsp;</p><p>In <em>Sister of Darkness</em>, Rachel Stavis takes us on a journey into an unseen world, describes the diverse range of entities that surround us, the Spirit Guides and Ancient Ancestors that come to her aid to reveal the root causes of your pain, and what you can do to protect yourself from creating a hospitable environment. A unique look at demonology removed from religious dogma, <em>Sister of Darkness</em> is the true story of Rachel&#x2019;s journey to becoming an exorcist. Chronicling some of her most extreme and interesting cleansings, the hows and the whys of what she does, and stories of danger and of triumph, Stavis creates a world that is at times frightening, eye-opening, and utterly enthralling.</p><p>Rachel Stavis is a screenwriter for film, television, and video games. She has published four horror novels under the name R. H. Stavis. She is also an exorcist, doing her work pro bono and without advertising her services.</p></p><h2>Fodor's New England: with the Best Fall Foliage Drives &amp; Scenic Road Trips (Full-color Travel Guide)</h2><p><p>Written by locals, Fodor's travel guides have been offering expert advice for all tastes and budgets for 80 years. <br><br><i>Fodor's New England</i>&nbsp;highlights the best&nbsp;this classic American destination has to offer:&nbsp; Boston's Revolutionary-era sites, Connecticut's antiques, Rhode Island's mansions, the rocky Maine coast, Vermont's Green Mountains, and New Hampshire's Lake District.

No case can defeat them--until they encounter a Gruesome Invincible Lightning Ghost. This smoking specter has claimed the penthouse suite of a beachfront hotel, where it passes its eternal vacation by turning guests into ghosts themselves. Could Hugo's slime douse the flaming phantom? Or are Tom and the team about to get burned?</p><p>Cornelia Funke is the internationally acclaimed, bestselling author of The Thief Lord, Dragon Rider, and the Inkheart trilogy, along with many other chapter and picture books for younger readers. She lives in Los Angeles, California, in a house filled with books.Kikrus<br>Intrepid veteran Hetty Hyssop, her young amanuensis Tom and their moody, slime-oozing<br>spectral associate Hugo nearly meet a fiery doom in this smoothly translated import, the second<br>episode of four originally published in Germany. Responding to the summons of a seaside hotel's<br>manager, the Ghosthunters expect to find only a minor fire ghost to snag&#x2013;but are instead confronted<br>by a huge GILIG (see title), a spirit so powerful that The Big Ghost Encyclopedia warns readers to<br>avoid contact at all costs. Standing fast as the hotel takes heavy damage and guests flee in terror (some<br>of this last, to be sure, caused by Hugo's pranks), the Ghosthunters discover the GILIG's weakness<br>just as they're about to be turned into ash, and the day is saved. Funke closes with a manual for<br>prospective ghosthunters, plus an elaborate taxonomy of ghostly types, from ASG (Averagely Spooky<br>Ghosts, which is Hugo's category) to FOFUG (Foggy Fug-Ghost). Replete with both spooks and with<br>comically cluttered illustrations, this will win many new fans. (Fantasy. 9-11)<br><br>SLJ<br>Gr 3-5&#x2013;In this sequel to Ghosthunters and the Incredibly Revolting Ghost (Scholastic, 2006), the phantom-fighting team is summoned to the remote Seafront Hotel to deal with another case of otherworldly mischief. The clues&#x2013;hot water, steam, and sulfurous odors&#x2013;seem to indicate the presence of a harmless Fire Ghost, but when Tom and Hetty Hyssop try to tackle the sizzling spook, they discover that there is a much more dangerous entity involved. Then Seafront guests begin disappearing, and the duo realize that they are outmatched. Only the third member of the crew, Hugo, an ASG (Averagely Spooky Ghost), has the occult skills to battle the sinister Lightning Ghost before it incinerates the hotel&#x2013;and everybody in it. The Ghosthunters are delightfully diverse: nine-year-old Tom is a cool-headed, cautious type; Hetty is a feisty, no-nonsense senior citizen; and complaining, pouting, ego-tripping Hugo is a reluctant contributor but always comes through in the end. Much of the humor is conveyed through crisp, lively dialogue and dramatic scene descriptions. While the team's off-the-wall techniques are generally played for laughs, there are also some genuinely scary moments. Black-and-white cartoon illustrations add to the fun. A winning combination of chills and chuckles.&#x2013;Elaine E. Knight, Lincoln Elementary Schools, IL<br><br></p><h2>Aladdin Electric Lamps</h2><p>Softcover</p><p>J.W.

Original.</p><p>Setting: England and Scotland, 1667 and 1816<p> Sensuality rating: 7</p><p> A titillating twist on the May-December romance, this offering from four popular authors, including <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers Jo Beverley and Cathy Maxwell, explores the reawakening of romance in women of experience, delivered in the delightful form of virile younger men. Cathy Maxwell's "A Man Who Can Dance" introduces readers to Graham McNab, a man standing on the cusp of achieving his lifelong dream of becoming a physician. However, fate intervenes in the form of woman--a gorgeous, flaxen-haired woman. Graham will do anything to make the vision his own, even if it means entering into a bet with his nasty cousin Blair. To win the bet, Graham must rely on his best friend, governess Sarah Ambrose to teach the untutored doctor to dance, in spite of his two left feet. Close proximity and the rhythm of the dance emulate the rhythm of love for Sarah and Graham. Will they become partners for life? Lauren Royal introduces readers to widow Clarice Bradford, who is devoted to raising her young daughter, Mary. Clarice is not looking for love when she is invited to attend a local wedding, but the ardent attentions of a younger man, Sir Cameron Leslie, make Clarice wonder just how thoroughly on the shelf she is or if there is a possibility of "Forevermore" in her future. "Written in the Stars" by Jaclyn Reding pits two lovers against an ancient prophesy. Harriet Drynan must marry a younger man to ensure the survival of her clan. But she's in love with her twin brother's best friend, Tristan Carmichael, and he loves her. Harriet fears the legend's curse that proclaims if she marries Tristan, he will die before the marriage can be consummated. A little leap year magic may bring the answer to our star-crossed lovers' prayers. "The Demon's Mistress" by Jo Beverley opens with a bang--almost. Maria Celestin, known by society as the Golden Lily, a beautiful widow just out of mourning, arrives just in time to stop George, Lord Vandeimen, from taking the coward's way out from under his debts and crumbling estate. Her proposition, that Van act as her affianced for six weeks in exchange for enough money to pay off his creditors and make the most urgent repairs to his home, intrigues him, as does the lady herself. Van suspects that Maria has an ulterior motive for approaching him, but he's willing to deliver whatever her heart desires. And her heart desires Van.

His driver maneuvered the jeep down the street as if in a road rally, swerving around piles of rubble, horse-drawn wagons, and languid pedestrians. He honked the horn yet again when an elderly couple pushing a wooden cart stacked with their few belongings tried to cross the street at the wrong time.</p><p>&#x201c;Dumb-ass krauts,&#x201d; the driver yelled as they blew past.</p><p>&#x201c;Corporal, you know the murder victim is already dead?&#x201d; Mason said.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then dial the speed down to somewhere below bat-out-of-hell.&#x201d;</p><p>The corporal slowed but purposely veered narrowly by two German ex-soldiers, still dressed in their shredded uniforms, then sent up his middle finger. &#x201c;<i>Sieg Heil</i>, motherfuckers!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m only going to say it one more time, Corporal. You will can that crap right now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Begging your pardon, sir, but you feel sorry for these people? First they&#x2019;re saluting Hitler and wanting to take over the world, and now look at &#x2019;em.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, look at them.&#x201d;</p><p>Mason nodded at the pitiful scene before their jeep. People huddled against the biting wind as they shuffled along a street lined with the blackened shells of buildings rising from a graveyard of brick and stone. The heavy gauze of snowfall made them appear as lost souls wandering purgatory, custodians of the dead buried beneath the rubble. Except for the old and the very young, few men moved among them. Women, always women. A line of women extended for blocks, waiting hours in the cold for a Red Cross center to open, hoping to receive a loaf of bread and a few ounces of lard. Others scoured the rubble looking for wood not already burned to fend off the cold. They formed knotted daisy chains salvaging brick and stone from the ruins, inspiring a new German word, <i>Trï¿½mmerfrauen</i>, meaning &#x201c;rubble women.&#x201d;</p><p>The corporal was a boy of no more than twenty-one and fresh off the streets of New York City. His name was Sal Manganella, but everyone called him Salamander. A fitting nickname&#x2014;all nose and chin. He noticed Mason looking at him and hunched his shoulders as if anticipating further rebuke. He relaxed when Mason looked away. &#x201c;Word is, they offered you a discharge, but you turned them down.&#x201d;</p><p>Mason waited a moment before responding. &#x201c;The army needs experienced cops, so I re-upped.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pardon my speaking freely, sir&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t seem to be a problem for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What kind of crackpot wants to stay in this hellhole when he could be a cop back in the States?&#x201d;</p><p>Mason remained silent. There was no way he was going to get into it with a snot-nosed kid whose only notion of the war was getting drunk and chasing frï¿½uleins.</p><p>War-torn Germany <i>was</i> a hellhole. The nation had surrendered seven months before, but millions would continue to die. Disease, starvation, and winter&#x2019;s icy embrace had replaced the bullets and bombs. And murder flourished in the ruins. Retribution, greed, madness, jealousy, and desperation all fed a hungry beast. Murder happened every day, hundreds in a week, thousands in a month.</p><p>Mason had been a reluctant guest of the German army from December 1944 until liberated in mid-April. After a two-month stint in a hospital with typhoid fever and dysentery, he&#x2019;d been offered a discharge. Much to the surprise and delight of the army staff, Mason had volunteered to stay on. He&#x2019;d worked an interminable six months at a desk job at U.S. Army headquarters in Frankfurt before his request to be transferred to the Criminal Investigation Division had finally been accepted. And now, less than two weeks after he arrived in Munich, he&#x2019;d landed his first homicide. It felt good to be back in the saddle.</p><p>Maybe here, among these ruins, Mason could find a new beginning, regeneration in a festering wound.</p><p>Manganella made another sharp turn, nearly throwing Mason into his lap. Mason was about to chew him out, when the corporal slammed on the brakes. Two U.S. Army military policemen held their hands high for them to stop. They stood in front of two jeeps parked to block the road. Four other MPs and two officers formed a wall that blocked Mason&#x2019;s view of whatever was causing the screaming bedlam behind them.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to have to turn around, sir,&#x201d; one of the MPs said. &#x201c;All hell&#x2019;s broken loose. We&#x2019;ve got a bunch of locals fighting it out over a cellar full of wine bottles.&#x201d;</p><p>Mason stood up in the jeep and peered over their heads. It was a madhouse. More than a hundred civilians were jammed in the narrow street acting as if possessed. Women screamed as they fought each other, pulling hair or using wine bottles as clubs. Old men whacked anyone within striking range, while clutching bottles to their chests. In the midst of the pandemonium emaciated children darted between sparring adults, taking boxes dropped during the fighting then disappearing into the gaps of the collapsed buildings. People emerged from what looked like a simple hole in the rubble with wine bottles or whole cases tucked in their arms. Some men stood among the fighters, paying no heed to their alcohol-fueled competitors as they smashed the neck of a bottle and downed as much wine as they could before throwing away the empty, and breaking the neck of the next.</p><p>An MP sergeant standing on a jeep with a bullhorn was shouting in English, &#x201c;Disperse. This is property of the U.S. Army. You will be arrested. Disperse. That&#x2019;s an order.&#x201d;</p><p>Corporal Manganella laughed at the spectacle, while off to Mason&#x2019;s right a small group of journalists took notes or snapped pictures. One of the photographers caught Mason&#x2019;s eye, an unexpected beauty among the beasts. She had a broad face framing a thin, upturned nose and stunning blue eyes. Her black hair was pulled back in an updo, victory-roll style, beneath a billed hat with the circular patch that identified her as a war correspondent sewn onto the crown. The journalist snapped another picture while sporting a mischievous smile. She, like the rest, was having a field day reporting on the day&#x2019;s version of chaos while the helpless MPs looked on.</p><p>Mason jumped out of the jeep and stepped up to the master sergeant. &#x201c;You better get this under control, Sergeant, or you&#x2019;re going to have a <i>real </i>riot on your hands.&#x201d;</p><p>The sergeant whirled around. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m goddamned trying&#x2014;&#x201d; He stopped when he saw Mason&#x2019;s CID bars. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re trying the best we can, sir. The damned radios we&#x2019;ve been issued are worthless. I had to send someone to headquarters for backup. They should be here in a few minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>Mason climbed up onto one of the MP jeeps, which had a mounted thirty-caliber machine gun. He pulled back the charger and whirled it on the crowd.</p><p>The sergeant yelled, &#x201c;Sir, that&#x2019;s against reg&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Mason fired a long burst above the heads of the crowd. The blasts from the machine gun were deafening. The bullets shattered brick and stone.</p><p>The crowd stopped in unison, stupefied by the man with the machine gun. Some froze with fists or bottles still poised to strike. Mason shouted in German, &#x201c;Stop this now. Get out of here. You do not want me lowering my aim.&#x201d;</p><p>There was no argument, no resuming the fight. Those who had been beating on their opponents a moment earlier were now helping them to their feet. They all began to disperse, women holding each other for support, drunken men staggering away, all leaving their once-prized booty on the ground or dropping it to the pavement with a crash. MP medics rushed in to take care of the injured sprawled on the wine-soaked pavement.</p><p>&#x201c;Who the hell is the moron on that machine gun?&#x201d; someone yelled at the far left side of the street. A bull-sized MP master sergeant came running up, red faced with anger.</p><p>The sergeant pointed at Mason.</p><p>The master sergeant stopped in midstride, came to stiff attention, and saluted. &#x201c;A fine idea, sir. I&#x2019;m not familiar with that method of crowd control. I&#x2019;m wondering, sir, if you would have carried out your threat if they hadn&#x2019;t stopped.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have you been on the receiving end of machine gun fire, Sergeant?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t say as I have, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have. It&#x2019;s a great motivator.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll remember that, sir. Anytime I want to make a point, I&#x2019;ll open fire on unarmed civilians.&#x201d;</p><p>The master sergeant stiffened and waited to be chewed out for his insubordination. Instead, Mason smiled and held out his hand. &#x201c;Mason Collins.&#x201d;</p><p>The sergeant&#x2019;s shoulders relaxed and he gave Mason a hearty handshake. &#x201c;Pleased to meet you, sir. I&#x2019;m Vincent Wolski. Actually, Warrant Officer Wolski, now that I&#x2019;m with the CID. Colonel Walton told me I was to partner with you&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need any partners,&#x201d; Mason said and started walking back to the jeep.</p><p>Wolski followed behind. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just following orders, sir. What you do with that is up to you.&#x201d;</p><p>Mason pointed to Wolski&#x2019;s master-sergeant patch. &#x201c;What are you doing with those stripes if you&#x2019;re CID?&#x201d;</p><p>CID was the army&#x2019;s acronym for Criminal Investigation Division, the army&#x2019;s detective bureau.</p><p>&#x201c;I was just transferred to the detachment this morning from the 508th C Company and didn&#x2019;t have time to change out of my uniform. A driver was taking me to the crime scene when we ran into this mess.&#x201d;</p><p>The 508th Military Police Battalion was in charge of law enforcement for Munich and the surrounding areas.</p><p>Mason stopped and eyed him for a moment. The man was big enough to play tackle for the NFL, and Mason saw the keenness in his eyes. But Wolski&#x2019;s most endearing quality, Mason thought, would be his subversive sense of humor. &#x201c;Tell your driver to go back to the station. You can ride with us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That was quite a display you put on back there,&#x201d; someone said behind him.</p><p>It was as much the velvety voice as the provocative statement that made Mason stop and turn around. The brunette reporter stood shoulder height and looked up at him with the same mischievous smile. She held out her hand. &#x201c;Laura McKinnon with the Associated Press.&#x201d;</p><p>Mason shook her hand. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t talk to reporters.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why not? Are you afraid?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I saw you over there snapping pictures of a dangerous situation with a big smile on your face. That&#x2019;s when a little alarm bell went off in my head.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not every day I see a soldier open fire on innocent civilians.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, ma&#x2019;am, I&#x2019;m happy to report that the result was damage to a few ruined buildings. And if I hadn&#x2019;t done that, people could have been killed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A rather dire prediction. I think some soldiers miss the war and look for any excuse to discharge their weapon.&#x201d;</p><p>Even without Miss McKinnon&#x2019;s sly smile, Mason got the play on words.</p><p>&#x201c;In June, while I was stationed in Frankfurt, three hundred recently released Russian POWs and displaced Poles rushed two tanker trucks full of industrial-grade alcohol. A drunken riot ensued that spilled over into the civilian population. It then grew to two thousand. In the thirty minutes it took for the MPs to arrive and the additional thirty minutes for them to decide to fire over their heads, over a hundred people died from beatings or alcohol poisoning. Another three hundred and fifty were hospitalized. We&#x2019;ll never know how many would have been saved if they&#x2019;d fired sooner. But you won&#x2019;t write about that. No, I can see it now&#x201d;&#x2014;Mason waved his hand in the air as if revealing a headline in bold letters&#x2014;&#x201c;&#x2018;CID Chief Warrant Officer Opens Fire on Innocent Civilians.&#x2019; That&#x2019;s why I don&#x2019;t like to talk to reporters. Good day, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;</p><p>Mason turned and strode toward the jeep before being trapped by her mesmerizing eyes. He jumped in the jeep and signaled for Manganella to take off.</p><p>&#x201c;What the hell was that riot all about?&#x201d; Manganella said as he reversed the jeep and drove back the way they had come.</p><p>&#x201c;Seems a group of civilians discovered a big wine cellar while recovering a couple of bodies from that collapsed building,&#x201d; Wolski said.</p><p>Once they were far enough away from the other MPs, Wolski pulled out a wine bottle from his overcoat and wagged it at Mason and Manganella. &#x201c;A 1927 Chateau Lafitte. That cellar was full of the best French wines. Now half the stuff is soaking into the pavement. A damn shame. I doubt many of the bottles are going to make it back to the collection depot.&#x201d;</p><p>Mason took the bottle from Wolski and examined it.</p><p>Corporal Manganella said, &#x201c;Some Nazi son of a bitch stole it from some poor French bastard. Spoils of war, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe I could have done more to stop those people, but I felt sorry for them,&#x201d; Wolski said. &#x201c;Can you imagine what a bottle of wine like this could get on the black market? At least a month&#x2019;s worth of food. Or better yet, a pile of blankets and a cartful of coal.&#x201d; He shook his head. &#x201c;Mid-December and already as cold as my ex-girlfriend&#x2019;s heart.&#x201d;</p><p>When Manganella turned the jeep onto the main thoroughfare, Mason ordered him to stop next to an old woman leading two small children. He held out the bottle to the woman, urging her to take it. The woman reached out and accepted it as if he&#x2019;d given her a diamond tiara. Mason signaled for Manganella to proceed. Manganella giggled as he did so. Wolski remained silent.</p><p>Mason adjusted the side-view mirror to look at Wolski. He liked the fact that the man hadn&#x2019;t whined or complained. &#x201c;You came from the 508th?&#x201d;</p><p>Wolski nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;Ever done any detective work?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Three years on the beat in Detroit, then three in vice squad before joining the army. My time on the force in Detroit is why they sent me over to you guys. That, and me driving my superior officer crazy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No homicide?&#x201d; Mason asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Vice isn&#x2019;t just about busting hookers and smut dealers. I collected evidence, ran interviews.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s better than some of the jokers they&#x2019;ve put in CID.&#x201d;</p><p>They entered another street of burned-out apartment buildings with boarded-up storefronts on the ground floor.</p><p>Wolski leaned forward. &#x201c;So, about your machine gun remark&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you must have seen some action.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Enough.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think you CID boys saw much fighting.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was an agent for G2 intelligence attached to the 422nd Regiment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I heard they got chewed up pretty bad in the Bulge.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Overrun and surrounded. I was out on a patrol and wound up behind enemy lines. They roughed me up pretty bad.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You were a POW?&#x201d;</p><p>Mason tended to avoid discussing it with anyone who hadn&#x2019;t been in combat, but Wolski was growing on him. &#x201c;Buchenwald for two weeks then transferred to a couple of POW stalags.&#x201d;</p><p>Wolski sat back in his seat. &#x201c;Buchenwald? Damn. No wonder&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No wonder what?&#x201d; Mason said and turned to Wolski.</p><p>&#x201c;No offense, sir. You got the right, is all I was going to say.&#x201d;</p><p>Corporal Manganella pulled up the jeep in front of a four-square-block, seven-story factory. The structure still stood, but it had been clearly gutted by fire, its brick scorched black by intense heat and smoke. Thick wooden beams propped diagonally against the wall kept it from collapsing.

Original.</p><p>Beautiful, rich Clare Turner is on death row, condemned for slitting the throats of her adopted parents. Now Terry Scanlan, the prosecutor who put her there, has fallen in love with her and become convinced that he's convicted an innocent woman. It's up to Bishop "Blackie" Ryan, ace detective of the diocese of Chicago, to right the wrong. Along the way he must solve a locked-room mystery, mollify the Mafia, reveal the sexual affair of the victims' neighbor, keep Turner alive amid jailhouse co-conspirators, find Turner's natural parents and survive a hit-and-run attempt on his own life. Greeley ( An Occasion of Sin ) clearly knows, reveres--and uses--every classic whodunit clue, red herring, plot twist and character. Homages to everyone from Sherlock Holmes to Twin Peaks abound, but Father Greeley successfully updates the traditional trappings of the "English genteel" mystery to weave a compelling tale. The weakest part of the story is Scanlan and Turner's love affair, which seems forced. However, the dialogue is lean and the plotting appropriately convoluted yet logical. Aficionados of the genre will find little about which to complain.

This title offers an interpretation of the artist, placing him firmly in the context of a period of traumatic social, cultural and political revolution.

The other, of course, is native son Salman Rushdie--less prolific, perhaps than Bollywood, but in his own way just as fantastical. Though Rushdie's novels lack the requisite six musical numbers that punctuate every Bombay talkie, they often share basic plot points with their cinematic counterparts. Take, for example, his 1980 Booker Prize-winning <i>Midnight's Children</i>: two children born at the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947--the moment at which India became an independent nation--are switched in the hospital. The infant scion of a wealthy Muslim family is sent to be raised in a Hindu tenement, while the legitimate heir to such squalor ends up establishing squatters' rights to his unlucky hospital mate's luxurious bassinet. Switched babies are standard fare for a Hindi film, and one can't help but feel that Rushdie's world-view--and certainly his sense of the fantastical--has been shaped by the films of his childhood. But whereas the movies, while entertaining, are markedly mediocre, <i>Midnight's Children</i> is a masterpiece, brilliant written, wildly unpredictable, hilarious and heartbreaking in equal measure.<p> Rushdie's narrator, Saleem Sinai, is the Hindu child raised by wealthy Muslims. Near the beginning of the novel, he informs us that he is falling apart--literally: </p><blockquote>I mean quite simply that I have begun to crack all over like an old jug--that my poor body, singular, unlovely, buffeted by too much history, subjected to drainage above and drainage below, mutilated by doors, brained by spittoons, has started coming apart at the seams. In short, I am literally disintegrating, slowly for the moment, although there are signs of an acceleration.</blockquote> In light of this unfortunate physical degeneration, Saleem has decided to write his life story, and, incidentally, that of India's, before he crumbles into "(approximately) six hundred and thirty million particles of anonymous, and necessarily oblivious, dust." It seems that within one hour of midnight on India's independence day, 1,001 children were born. All of those children were endowed with special powers: some can travel through time, for example; one can change gender. Saleem's gift is telepathy, and it is via this power that he discovers the truth of his birth: that he is, in fact, the product of the illicit coupling of an Indian mother and an English father, and has usurped another's place. His gift also reveals the identities of all the other children and the fact that it is in his power to gather them for a "midnight parliament" to save the nation. To do so, however, would lay him open to that other child, christened Shiva, who has grown up to be a brutish killer. Saleem's dilemma plays out against the backdrop of the first years of independence: the partition of India and Pakistan, the ascendancy of "The Widow" Indira Gandhi, war, and, eventually, the imposition of martial law.<p> We've seen this mix of magical thinking and political reality before in the works of Gï¿½nter Grass and Gabriel Garcï¿½a Mï¿½rquez. What sets Rushdie apart is his mad prose pyrotechnics, the exuberant acrobatics of rhyme and alliteration, pun, wordplay, proper and "Babu" English chasing each other across the page in a dizzying, exhilarating cataract of words. Rushdie can be laugh-out-loud funny, but make no mistake--this is an angry book, and its author's outrage lends his language wings. <i>Midnight's Children</i> is Salman Rushdie's irate, affectionate love song to his native land--not so different from a Bombay talkie, after all. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Born at the stroke of midnight at the exact moment of India&#x2019;s independence, Saleem Sinai is a special child. However, this coincidence of birth has consequences he is not prepared for: telepathic powers connect him with 1,000 other &#x2018;midnight&#x2019;s children&#x2019; all of whom are endowed with unusual gifts. Inextricably linked to his nation, Saleem&#x2019;s story is a whirlwind of disasters and triumphs that mirrors the course of modern India at its most impossible and glorious</p><h2>Diaghilev</h2><p>Biography of one of the central figures in the cultural life and tastes of his time.</p><p></p><h2>The Documentary Impulse</h2><p><p><strong>Award-winning photographer Stuart Franklin's exploration of how we, as humans, are driven to visually document our experiences and the world around us.</strong></p><p>Stuart Franklin took one of the most powerful photographs of the twentieth century - the 'tank man' in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, 1989.

Upon returning to the United States, he found that the counterpart that continued the tradition for him was the linear and stylized design of the santos.

Whether as retablos , which are paintings on wood, or bultos , their sculptural counterparts, santos act as direct intermediaries with divine personalities and are even rewarded or punished according to their level of assistance. These unique Hispanic American icons are rooted in Catholic baroque style, but harsh living conditions, relative isolation, and limited imported materials fostered a simpler linear style suggestive of medieval art. With the years 1780-1907 marking the peak of their production, this true folk tradition of the Americas has been neglected until recently.

As a child he discovered his love of books, reading, and stories, devouring the works of C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, James Branch Cabell, Edgar Allan Poe, Michael Moorcock, Ursula K. LeGuin, Gene Wolfe, and G.K. Chesterton. A self-described "feral child who was raised in libraries," Gaiman credits librarians with fostering a life-long love of reading: "I wouldn't be who I am without libraries. I was the sort of kid who devoured books, and my happiest times as a boy were when I persuaded my parents to drop me off in the local library on their way to work, and I spent the day there.

Full list here. The author lives in Minneapolis, MN..Gaiman reenlists the remarkable artist who made Creatures of the Night (2004) so staggeringly beautiful. Here Michael Zulli&nbsp;visualizes a much better story from Smoke and Mirrors (1998),&nbsp;which was excluded from its American edition. In it, a fantasy writer much like Gaiman recalls a strange night in London. Prodded out by an old pal and his wife, he meets their biogeologist acquaintance, Miss Finch, at dinner and goes with them to an odd, animal-free circus performing in the cellars underneath the train tracks near Southwark Cathedral. The audience is ambulatory, passing from one chamber to another to see various ostensibly spooky acts; scientifically skeptical Miss Finch is not amused. In the next-to-last room, Miss Finch is pulled away, stoutly protesting, by a performer who says her most ardent wish&nbsp;will be granted in the ninth room. It is. In his characteristic crisp pen-and-ink and watercolor, Zulli has a field day with the garish, freakish, ultimately animal (after all) circus denizens, and he renders regular London interiors and exteriors as gorgeously fore and aft of the circus sequence. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Superman: Action Comics Vol. 4: Hybrid (The New 52)</h2><p>Determained to turn the people of Metropolis against the Man of Steel and finally vanquish him from the Earth, Lex Luthor unleashes a virus on Metropolis capable of rewriting the DNA of those infected, including Superman.<br><br>While Superman's immune system eventually fights off the infection, but not before a hybrid Superman is created through the virus' ability to rewrite DNA.&nbsp; This new hybrid Superman is the only being capable of defeating the true Superman and Lex will stop at nothing to see it accomplish it's mission.<br><br>Collects Action Comics #19-24, and stories from Young<br>Romance: The New 52 #1 and Superman Annual #2<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Andy Diggle is one of the UK&#39;s leading comic-book writers, and former editor of the cult British comic 2000AD.

Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, whose acclaimed translations of The Brothers Karamazov and Crime and Punishment have become the standard versions in English, now give us a superb new rendering of this early classic. Presented as the fictional apology and confession of the underground man - formerly a minor official of mid-nineteenth-century Russia, whom Dostoevsky leaves nameless, as one critic wrote, &#34;because &#39;I&#39; is all of us&#34; - the novel is divided into two parts: the first, a half-desperate, half-mocking political critique; the second, a powerful, at times absurdly comical account of the man&#39;s breakaway from society and descent &#34;underground&#34;. The book&#39;s extraordinary style - brilliantly violating literary conventions in ways never before attempted - shocked its first readers and still shocks many Russians today. This magnificent new translation captures for the first time all the stunning idiosyncrasy of the original.Dostoevsky?s most revolutionary novel,<i> Notes from Underground</i> marks the dividing line between 19th- and 20th- century fiction, and between the visions of self each century embodied. One of the most remarkable characters in literature, the unnamed narrator is a former official who has defiantly withdrawn into an underground existence. In full retreat from society, he scrawls a passionate, obsessive, self-contradictory narrative that serves as a devastating attack on social utopianism and an assertion of man?s essentially irrational nature.<br>Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, whose Dostoevsky translations have become the standard, give us a brilliantly faithful edition of this classic novel, conveying all the tragedy and tormented comedy of the original.</p><h2>Why Pi?: How Math Applies to Everyday Life</h2><p>Why Pi?: How Math Applies to Everyday Life</p><p></p><h2>Crash</h2><p>Early UK edition of J.

He has been awarded the August Prize, the Swedish National Book Award, and the Nordic Prize, and his novels have been published in more than twenty-five languages. In 1991, Lindgren was elected to the Swedish Academy, the eighteen-member committee that selects the honorees for the Nobel Prize for Literature.Two seekers pursue the perfect plate of hash, and, by extension, the force of life in Lindgren's sparkling novel (after <i>Bathsheba</i> and <i>The Way of the Serpent</i>). In 1947, a newspaper reporter is fired for fabricating stories ("The dramatic week-long struggle to rescue an elk from Hob&#x2122;ck Marsh," his editor accuses him, "never took place.... [and t]here has never been a turkey farm ravaged by a bear in your district") and forbidden to write another word. For more than five decades the reporter doesn't put pen to paper. As a 107-year-old inmate in the Sunnybank Rest Home, he returns, after his editor dies, to the story he left unfinished, which concerned two newcomers to the Swedish village of Avaback, site of a tuberculosis epidemic. Schoolteacher Lars Hogstrom picked the post ("pulmonary tuberculosis [is] closest to my heart," he quips) while Martin Bormann was an escaped Nazi war criminal then calling himself Robert Maser. United by their love of music and passion for hash, Maser (posing as a traveling fabric salesman) and Hogstrom had set off on a quest to sample all of the region's hashes, a journey at once comical and sublime. Hash, whose foul ingredients (hooves, offal, entrails, grain, etc.) add up to a surprising delicacy, symbolizes life, love, art and mercy. Tuberculosis a "fickle" disease that leads, Maser suggests, to "[m]odernist poetry. Atonal music. Anarchic political programs.... pure and simple idiocy," represents, among other things, death's power to make life more precious. Above all, this sly and gleeful novel is about storytelling itself, about how fiction even fiction cooked up from a recipe of grotesqueries and absurdity can contain fundamental truths.<br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

So begins the story of Dolores Price, the unconventional heroine of Wally Lamb's <i>She's Come Undone</i>. Dolores is a class-A emotional basket case, and why shouldn't she be? She's suffered almost every abuse and familial travesty that exists: Her father is a violent, philandering liar; her mother has the mental and emotional consistency of Jell-O; and the men in her life are probably the gender's most loathsome creatures. But Dolores is no quitter; she battles her woes with a sense of self-indulgence and gluttony rivaled only by Henry VIII. Hers is a dysfunctional <i>Wonder Years</i>, where growing up in the golden era was anything but ideal. While most kids her age were dealing with the monumental importance of the latest Beatles single and how college turned an older sibling into a long-haired hippie, Dolores was grappling with such issues as divorce, rape, and mental illness. Whether you're disgusted by her antics or moved by her pathetic ploys, you'll be drawn into Dolores's warped, hilarious, Mallomar-munching world.<i>"Mine is a story of craving: an unreliable account of lusts and troubles that began, somehow, in 1956 on the day our free television was delivered...."</i> <p> Meet Dolores Price. She's 13, wise-mouthed but wounded, having bid her childhood goodbye. Beached like a whale in front of her bedroom TV, she spends the next few years nourishing herself with the Mallmomars, potato chips, and Pepsi her anxious mother supplies. When she finally rolls into young womanhood at 257 pounds, Dolores is no stronger and life is no kinder. But this time she's determined to rise to the occasion and give herself one more chance before <i>really</i> going belly up. </p><p> In this extraordinary coming-of-age odyssey, Wally Lamb invites us to hitch a wild ride on a journey of love, pain, and renewal with the most heartbreakingly comical heroine to come along in years. At once a fragile girl and a hard-edged cynic, so tough to love yet so inimitably lovable, Dolores is as poignantly real as our own imperfections. <i>She's Come Undone</i> includes a promise: you will never forget Dolores Price.</p></p><h2>Mountain Lamb</h2><p>Mountain Lamb, the most beautiful Indian woman of the Wind River Range, defies her tribe when she falls for Joe Meek, the Bear Killer, a mountain man and trapper, but their love is threatened by growing violence between the Indians and the white settlers</p><p></p><h2>Mr. China: A Memoir</h2><p><p>The idea of China has always exerted a pull on the adventurous type. There is a kind of entrepreneurial Westerner who just can't resist it: red flags, a billion bicycles, and the largest untapped market on earth. What more could they want? After the first few visits, they start to feel more in tune and experience the first stirrings of a fatal ambition: the secret hope of becoming the Mr. China of their time.</p><p>In the 1990s, China went through a miraculous transformation from a closed backwater to the workshop of the world. Many smart young men saw this transformation coming and mistook it for their destiny. Not a few rushed East to gain strategic footholds, plant their flags, and prosper. After all, the Chinese had numbers on their side: a seemingly endless population, a thirst for resources, and the tide of history. What they needed was Western knowledge and lots of capital. Or so it seemed ...</p><p><strong>Mr. China</strong> tells the rollicking story of one man's encounter with the Chinese. Armed with hundreds of millions of dollars and a strong sense that he and his partners were -- like missionaries of capitalism -- descending into the industrial past to bring the Chinese into the modern world, Clissold got the education of a lifetime.</p><p>The ordinary Chinese workers, business owners, local bureaucrats, and party cadres Clissold encountered were some of the most committed, resourceful, and creative operators he would ever meet. They were happy to take the foreigner's money but resisted just about anything else. At every turn, the locals seemed one step ahead of Clissold's crew threatening to take the Westerners for all they were worth.</p><p>In the end, <strong>Mr. China</strong> isn't a tale of business or an expatriate's love for his adopted land. It's one man's coming-of-age story where he learns to respect and admire the nation he sought to conquer.</p></p><p><p>Tim Clissold has lived and worked in China for more than twenty years and has traveled to most parts of the country. After graduating with degrees in physics and theoretical physics from Cambridge University, and working in London, Australia, and Hong Kong, he developed a fascination with China. He spent two years studying Mandarin in Beijing before cofounding a private equity group that invested more than $400 million there. He has since spent time at Goldman Sachs recovering distressed assets and, more recently, started a business that invests in projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in China through the UN's Clean Development Mechanism. <em>Mr. China</em> was his first book. It has been translated into twelve languages and was an <em>Economist</em> magazine Book of the Year.</p>A British businessman with a background in accounting and auditing, Clissold joined up with an entrepreneur in the early 1990s and set out to buy shares of Chinese firms and to work to make them more profitable. Within two years, Clissold's venture owned shares in 20 Chinese businesses, with 25,000 employees among them, but the story really centers on Clissold's encounters with the nation's "institutionalized confusion." Firing entrenched middle managers became a protracted process that led to factory riots and employees using company funds to set up competing businesses; the anticorruption bureau demanded cash bribes before opening investigations. Clissold's narrative is somewhat aimless, slipping from one misadventure (taking American fund managers to a condom factory) to the next, and there's a certain amount of too-easy humor derived from the exoticism of Chinese culture (e.g., the inevitable banquet where unusual body parts of rabbit and deer are served). Even in these passages, though, Clissold's fundamental respect for the Chinese culture is unmistakable, and the scenes where he leaves his office and interacts directly with the people can be quite vividly detailed. By the late '90s, millions of dollars poured into the companies yield disastrous results from an investment standpoint (and Clissold himself suffers a heart attack), but the Chinese economy as a whole hums ever more loudly. Crossover appeal of this title may be limited, but business readers are likely to be entertained. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

White is a professor whose seemingly enviable existence of relative ease has left him nonetheless in despair. Black, an ex-con and ex-addict, is the more hopeful of the men though he is just as desperate to convince White of the power of faith as White is desperate to deny it. Their aim is no less than this: to discover the meaning of life.Deft, spare, and full of artful tension, The Sunset Limited is a beautifully crafted, consistently thought-provoking, and deceptively intimate work by one of the most insightful writers of our time.</p><p>Cormac McCarthy is the author of nine novels, among other literary works. His many honors include the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award.This is a room in a tenement building in a black ghetto in New York City. There is a kitchen with a stove and a large refrigerator. A door to the outer hallway and another presumably to a bedroom. The hallway door is fitted with a bizarre collection of locks and bars. There is a cheap formica table in the room and two chrome and plastic chairs. There is a drawer in the table. On the table is a bible and a newspaper. A pair of glasses. A pad and pencil. A large black man is sitting in one chair (stage right) and in the other a middle-aged white man dressed in running pants and athletic shoes.

Maybe birthdays are dangerous. Like Christmas. Ornaments hanging from the trees, wreaths from the doors, and bodies from the steampipes all over America.<br><br>Black: Mm.

I just wondered if that was your regular method.<br><br>White: I dont have a regular method. I just put it on.<br><br>Black: Mm hm.<br><br>White: It's what, effeminate?<br><br>Black: Mm.<br><br>White: What?<br><br>Black: Nothin.

I didnt ask for you to leap into my arms down in the subway this mornin.<br><br>White: I didnt leap into your arms.<br><br>Black: You didnt?<br><br>White: No. I didnt.<br><br>Black: Well how did you get there then?<br><br>The professor stands with his head lowered. He looks at the chair and then turns and goes and sits down in it.<br><br>Black: What. Now we aint goin?<br><br>White: Do you really think that Jesus is in this room?<br><br>Black: No. I dont think he's in this room.<br><br>White: You dont?<br><br>Black: I know he's in this room.<br><br>The professor folds his hands at the table and lowers his head. The black pulls out the other chair and sits again.<br><br>Black: Its the way you put it, Professor. Be like me askin you do you think you got your coat on. You see what I'm sayin?<br><br>White: It's not the same thing. It's a matter of agreement. If you and I say that I have my coat on and Cecil says that I'm naked and I have green skin and a tail then we might want to think about where we should put Cecil so that he wont hurt himself.<br><br>Black: Who's Cecil?<br><br>White: He's not anybody. He's just a hypothetical . . . There's not any Cecil. He's just a person I made up to illustrate a point.<br><br>Black: Made up.<br><br>White: Yes.<br><br>Black: Mm.<br><br>White: We're not going to get into this again are we? It's not the same thing. The fact that I made Cecil up.<br><br>Black: But you did make him up.<br><br>White: Yes.<br><br>Black: And his view of things dont count.<br><br>White: No. That's why I made him up. I could have changed it around. I could have made you the one that didnt think I was wearing a coat.<br><br>Black: And was green and all that shit you said.<br><br>White: Yes.<br><br>Black: But you didnt.<br><br>White: No.<br><br>Black: You loaded it off on Cecil.<br><br>White: Yes.<br><br>Black: But Cecil cant defend hisself cause the fact that he aint in agreement with everbody else makes his word no good. I mean aside from the fact that you made him up and he's green and everthing.<br><br>White: He's not the one who's green. I am. Where is this going?<br><br>Black: I'm just tryin to find out about Cecil.<br><br>White: I dont think so. Can you see Jesus?<br><br>Black: No. I cant see him.<br><br>White: But you talk to him.<br><br>Black: I dont miss a day.<br><br>White: And he talks to you.<br><br>Black: He has talked to me. Yes.<br><br>White: Do you hear him? Like out loud?<br><br>Black: Not out loud. I dont hear a voice. I dont hear my own, for that matter. But I have heard him.<br><br>White: Well why couldnt Jesus just be in your head?<br><br>Black: He is in my head.<br><br>White: Well I don't understand what it is that you're trying to tell me.<br><br>Black: I know you dont, honey. Look. The first thing you got to understand is that I aint got a original thought in my head. If it aint got the lingerin scent of divinity to it then I aint interested.<br><br>White: The lingering scent of divinity.<br><br>Black: Yeah. You like that?<br><br>White: It's not bad.<br><br>Black: I heard it on the radio. Black preacher. But the point is I done tried it the other way. And I dont mean chippied, neither. Runnin blindfold through the woods with the bit tween your teeth. Oh man. Didnt I try it though. If you can find a soul that give it a better shot than me I'd like to meet him. I surely would. And what do you reckon it got me?<br><br>White: I dont know. What did it get you?<br><br>Black: Death in life. That's what it got me.<br><br>White: Death in life.<br><br>Black: Yeah. Walkin around death. Too dead to even know enough to lay down.<br><br>White: I see.<br><br>Black: I dont think so. But let me ask you this question.<br><br>White: All right.<br><br>Black: Have you ever read this book?<br><br>White: I've read parts of it. I've read in it.<br><br>Black: Have you ever read it?<br><br>White: I read The Book of Job.<br><br>Black: Have. You. Ever. Read. It.<br><br>White: No.<br><br>Black: But you is read a lot of books.<br><br>White: Yes.<br><br>Black: How many would you say you read?<br><br>White: I've no idea.<br><br>Black: Ball park.<br><br>White: I dont know. Two a week maybe. A hundred a year. For close to forty years.<br><br>The black takes up his pencil and licks it and falls to squinting at his pad, adding numbers laboriously, his tongue in the corner of his mouth, one hand on his head.<br><br>White: Forty times a hundred is four thousand.<br><br>Black: (Almost laughing) I'm just messin with you, Professor. Give me a number. Any number you like. And I'll give you forty times it back.<br><br>White: Twenty-six.<br><br>Black: A thousand and forty.<br><br>White: A hundred and eighteen.<br><br>Black: Four thousand seven hundred and twenty.<br><br>White: Four thousand seven hundred and twenty.<br><br>Black: Yeah.<br><br>White: The answer is the question.<br><br>Black: Say what?<br><br>White: That's your new number.<br><br>Black: Four thousand seven hundred and twenty?<br><br>White: Yes.<br><br>Black: That's a big number, Professor.<br><br>White: Yes it is.<br><br>Black: Do you know the answer?<br><br>White: No. I dont.<br><br>Black: It's a hundred and eighty-eight thousand and eight hundred.<br><br>They sit.<br><br>White: Let me have that.<br><br>The black slides the pad and pencil across the table. The professor does the figures and looks at them and looks at the black. He slides the pencil and paper back across the table and sits back.<br><br>White: How do you do that?<br><br>Black: Numbers is the black man's friend. Butter and eggs. Crap table. You quick with numbers you can put the mojo on you brother. Confiscate the contents of his pocketbook. You get a lot of time to practice that shit in the jailhouse.<br><br>White: I see.<br><br>Black: But let's get back to all them books you done read. You think maybe you read four thousand books.<br><br>White: Probably. Maybe more than that.<br><br>Black: But you aint read this one.<br><br>White: No. Not the whole book. No.<br><br>Black: Why is that?<br><br>White: I dont know.<br><br>Black: What would you say is the best book that ever was wrote?<br><br>White: I have no idea.<br><br>Black: Take a shot.<br><br>White: There are a lot of good books.<br><br>Black: Well pick one.<br><br>White: Maybe War and Peace.<br><br>Black: All right. You think that's a better book than this one?<br><br>White: I dont know. They're different kinds of books.<br><br>Black: This War and Peace book. That's a book that somebody made up, right?<br><br>White: Well, yes.<br><br>Black: So is that how it's different from this book?<br><br>White: Not really. In my view they're both made up.<br><br>Black: Mm. Aint neither one of em true.<br><br>White: Not in the historical sense. No.<br><br>Black: So what would be a true book?<br><br>White: I suppose maybe a history book. Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire might be one. At least the events would be actual events. They would be things that had happened.<br><br>Black: Mm hm. You think that book is as good a book as this book here?<br><br>White: The bible.<br><br>Black: The bible.<br><br>White: I dont know. Gibbon is a cornerstone. It's a major book.<br><br>Black: And a true book. Dont forget that.<br><br>White: And a true book. Yes.<br><br>Black: But is it as good a book.<br><br>White: I dont know. I dont know as you can make a comparison. You're talking about apples and pears.<br><br>Black: No we aint talkin bout no apples and pears, Professor. We talkin bout books. Is that Decline and Fall book as good a book as this book here. Answer the question.<br><br>White: I might have to say no.<br><br>Black: It's more true but it aint as good.<br><br>White: If you like.<br><br>Black: It aint what I like. It's what you said.<br><br>White: All right.<br><br>The black lays the bible back down on the table.<br><br>Black: It used to say here on the cover fore it got wore off: The greatest book ever written. You think that might be true?<br><br>White: It might.<br><br>Black: You read good books.<br><br>White: I try to. Yes.<br><br>Black: But not the best book. Why is that?<br><br>White: I need to go.<br><br>Black: You dont need to go, Professor. Stay here and visit with me.<br><br>White: You're afraid I'll go back to the train station.<br><br>Black: You might. Just stay with me.<br><br>White: What if I promised I wouldnt?<br><br>Black: You might anyways.<br><br>White: Dont you have to go to work?<br><br>Black: I was on my way to work.<br><br>White: A funny thing happened to you on your way to work.<br><br>Black: Yes it did.<br><br>White: Will they fire you?<br><br>Black: Naw.

Tommy, a delicate black boy, is cursed with health problems and drawn to trouble more often than not. Eric is a Nordic Adonis, graced by a seemingly endless supply of good fortune. When tragedy rips their makeshift family apart, the two boys are set on courses that diverge astonishingly. In a riveting tale of resilience and redemption that traces their parallel lives, Tommy and Eric ultimately reunite after years apart and draw on their childhood bond as they confront together the forces that threaten to destroy them.</p><p>Walter Mosley is the author of the acclaimed Easy Rawlins series of mysteries and numerous other works of fiction and nonfiction. He lives in New York.Welcome one more of Mosley's departures from mystery fiction. FORTUNATE SON is a compassionate, lyrical, and heartbreaking story of the parallel lives of two "brothers." Lorraine Toussaint brilliantly follows the two boys: Tommy, unhealthy and plagued by the harshest of life's realities, and golden boy Eric, a privileged doctor's son. The melodrama is occasionally inflated, edging to improbable, and could be over the top in the hands of a less gifted narrator. Toussaint's thoughtful yet precise handling of the characters and relationships deeply touches the listener. She never misses the opportunity to color an unusual character, making the most of Mosley's people. The boys' lives are interwoven with tragedy and loyalty, and Toussaint is a sensitive and intuitive narrator delivering a velvety punch. R.F.W.

Intertwining sculpture with painting, his work transcends both traditional portraiture and caricature.This is the first major book on Red Grooms&#39;s work published since 1984 and includes many drawings, personal photographs, and prints that have never been seen or published. Many of his famed sculpto-pictoramas appear in full color and some in gatefolds, such as Moby Dick Meets the NYPL, Tennessee Carousel, and The Marathon. Grooms&#39;s 1995 Grand Central Terminal is still remembered by thousands as a peak artistic experience. Other environments include an agricultural building for the Des Moines Art Center in Iowa, the beloved Ruckus Manhattan (complete with subway car and Brooklyn Bridge), and a Ruckus Rodeo commissioned by the Fort Worth Museum of Modern Art.</p><p><br><b>Arthur Danto</b> is a retired professor of philosophy at Columbia University.

Starting with a childhood that molded her perfectly to fall for the seduction of the king of porn,&#x201d; this autobiography recounts the perilous road that Dawn Schiller traveled from drugs and addiction to beatings, arrests, forced prostitution, and being sold to the drug underworld. After living through the horrific Wonderland murders of 1981, she entered protective custody, ran from the FBI, and turned in John Holmes to the police. This is the true story of a young girl&#x2019;s harrowing escape from one of the most infamous public figures, her struggle to survive, and her recovery from unthinkable abuse.</p><p><p>Dawn Schiller was fifteen years old in 1976, when she met thirty-two-year-old porn star John Holmes. Holmes courted Dawn, had sex with her, and manipulated her with drugs and alcohol. Holmes physically and emotionally abused Dawn for several years. After the famed Wonderland murders in 1981, they fled to Florida, where she ultimately broke free and turned him over to the police.</p><p>Dawn eventually relocated to northern California and finally to the Pacific Northwest, where she now lives with her daughter. In addition to being a devoted mother, Dawn has worked as an associate producer and consultant on the movie <i>Wonderland</i> (she was portrayed by actress Kate Bosworth; John Holmes was played by Val Kilmer).</p><p>Dawn is adamant about relating her story with the hope that any other young teen won't fall into the same hell that she did. She has developed a national presentation titled "Our Throwaway Teens Who Are They and How Can We Help?" to raise awareness of the vulnerabilities of teens growing up in abusive and neglectful environments. Dawn educates audiences about what a teen might be experiencing internally when targeted and groomed by a predator, how to identify a young victim in trouble, pedophile seduction techniques, and the use of drugs to manipulate and trap a victim. She gives an inside view of what it&#x2019;s like to be a "throwaway teen" and how we, as a community, can help. Dawn is also excited to announce E.S.T.E.A.M., Empowering Successful Teens through Education, Awareness &amp; Mentoring, a newly registered nonprofit dedicated to assisting teens who are struggling to find a safe and successful path to adulthood.</p><p>Today, Dawn is the proud parent of a beautiful daughter. She works full time at a university in the arts and science department, is on the committee to revise the university&#x2019;s sexual harassment policy, and is a member of the President&#x2019;s Commission on the Status of Women (PCSW). Nationally she is a member of the education committee and is an advisory board member for the National Center of Victims of Crime as well as a TTEC consultant for the Office for Victims of Crime out of Washington, D.C. She is an advisory board member for The Americans Overseas Domestic Violence Crisis Center as well as Voices Set Free. She presented for End Violence Against Women International (EVAW) in 2010 and represented Val Kilmer in New York for the Volvo For Life Awards in both 2006 and 2008. But most importantly, Dawn has spent the last six years completing her memoir, <i>The Road Through Wonderland</i>. Nominated for the R.O.S.E. (Regaining One&#x2019;s Self-Esteem) award in 2007, 2008, and 2009, and the Sunshine Peace Award in 2010, Dawn has been abstinent from drugs and alcohol for many years.</p><p>For information on Dawn or her book, or to have Dawn speak at your event, please contact her at ESTEAM.one@gmail.com.</p>"Curiously enough for a book concerned with notorious pornographic film star John Holmes, there is very little emphasis on sex here.

Danger threatens from all sides. The Americans are using phosphorous shells, against which all extinguishers are useless... In a world in which havoc spreads far more quickly than life can burgeon, to look more than fifteen minutes ahead is pointless.&#x201d; Entry for 4 April 1945. <br><br>From 1943 to 1945, while his world was deafened by the sounds of war as Germany fought on hopelessly, Hans-Georg von Studnitz &#x2013; from his vantage point in the German Foreign Office Press and Information Section &#x2013; recorded the day-to-day events in Berlin. He was in the perfect position to write such an account: he was entrusted with the drafting of Nazi political directives and was in constant touch with the foreign diplomats stationed in Berlin.<br><br>This is a fascinating and comprehensive insight into life in Berlin: the bombings and its effects, the social life, the key personalities and events.

He examines African inventions and civilizations from 16,000 BCE to 1800 CE from the northern tip of Tunisia to the Cape of Good Hope in the south.</p><p>Logically organized by topic and era, Ehret&#x2019;s heavily illustrated and easily accessible text reveals the diversity of African history. It explores the wide range of social and cultural as well as technological and economic change in Africa, and it depicts African agricultural, social, political, cultural, technological, and economic history in relation to developments in the rest of the world. Designed to address the glaring lack of texts concentrating on Africa before 1800, this book can be fruitfully combined with histories of Africa since 1800 to build a full and well-rounded understanding of the roles of Africa&#x2019;s peoples in human history.</p></p><p><p>Christopher Ehret is Professor of History at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of An African Classical Age: Eastern and Southern Africa in World History, 1000 B.C. to A.D. 400 (Virginia).</p><p>&nbsp;[C]hallenging and innovative...thorough and masterful...

It&#x2019;s parked just down the block, never in the same spot twice, but always within easy view of Phoebe&#x2019;s peering eyes. The older Ford Focus, with its rusted fenders and a cracked windshield that makes seeing the driver almost impossible, even with powerful binoculars, would go unnoticed almost anywhere else in Chicago. But on a quiet Lake Forest street, where a three-year-old Land Rover seems ancient, it sticks out like a rotting incisor in a set of bleached teeth. The only clue to the driver&#x2019;s identity is a magnet on the front passenger door that says <i>Executive Courier Services</i>, but she has yet to see any delivery take place.<br> Phoebe isn&#x2019;t exactly sure when the car first started showing up, but once she noticed its repeat visits, she began keeping a log like the sort of busybody neighborhood watch captain that would ordinarily annoy her. In the little notebook are three columns: when the car arrives, where it parks, when it leaves. The appearances seemed more sporadic at first, maybe two or three times a week, for an hour at most. But for the last week, the car has been there daily and staying for at least three hours, sometimes as many as five, well beyond any normal break in a workday. If the occupant has exited to so much as stretch their legs, Phoebe hasn&#x2019;t noticed. She has considered asking the neighbors what they think about this interloper, but in the five years she&#x2019;s lived in this house, she hasn&#x2019;t gone out of her way to make friends with any of them.<br> It&#x2019;s not that she doesn&#x2019;t like people. She just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, maybe that isn&#x2019;t too far from the truth. People are burdensome beasts, always prepared to lump their expectations onto you. This is especially true if your name lends you a little status, however dubious that status may now be.<br> She&#x2019;s tried expressing these concerns to her husband, but Wyatt thinks she&#x2019;s being paranoid, about both the recurring car and what the neighbors probably think of her. He insists it&#x2019;s just stress, that the media frenzy will pass when someone else either dies or says something stupid approximately three seconds from now. Because he&#x2019;s a therapist, his smugness when he says these things is thick enough to gag her. The subtext, of course, is that she has far too little to do with her day if parked cars and imagined gossip are the sorts of things that occupy her mind. He may be right, but it still makes her grit her teeth.<br> Calling the police is an option she&#x2019;s mulled over a few times, but what exactly would she say? This isn&#x2019;t a gated community. People can come and go as they please. A lifetime ago, a less reclusive Phoebe wasn&#x2019;t interested in a walled-off fortress like so many of the other places here, or especially like her father&#x2019;s oppressive lakefront estate in Glencoe. She was taken by this house&#x2019;s relative normalcy, how openly the modest-by-comparison Tudor-style home at the end of the lush cul-de-sac presented itself to the world, with only a couple of neighboring houses in decent but not overly intimate proximity. That accessibility is biting her in the ass now with this car in the picture, but then again, she&#x2019;s received no threats or strange phone calls. All she has is exhaustion-fueled speculation, and not even a description of the driver, who she&#x2019;s about 90 percent positive is either a woman or a very slight man, based mostly on the petite silhouette. The only other details she can note with any confidence are the light blue shirt and baseball cap, an apparent uniform. Because she&#x2019;s probably just a flipping delivery driver, she thinks in her husband&#x2019;s calmly exasperated voice. So no, she won&#x2019;t call the cops. Not until she has a real reason.<br> Of course, Phoebe could put all these questions to rest right now. Just step outside, walk up to the car, knock on the window, and kindly ask what they want. But with everything else going on, she can&#x2019;t handle the thought of being even a little humiliated. What if this really is just some lowly courier who likes to sit there for breaks and catch up on paperwork? Or a friend of one of the neighbors Phoebe has spent years ignoring? She can already hear them gossiping. Oh, her? That&#x2019;s Phoebe Miller. Haven&#x2019;t you heard of her? Well, surely you know about her father&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> Then there&#x2019;s the worst-case scenario, that this courier could actually be a reporter scoping her out, waiting to catch some unflattering footage of a disheveled heiress at the height of her paranoid desperation. The public would cease to function without its regular dose of schadenfreude, after all. Why shouldn&#x2019;t she have her time in the limelight?<br> But she&#x2019;s also begun to consider a likelier reason for her inaction: watching this car has become a game for her, a blip in her otherwise flat line of a day. The truth of this person is probably so mundane, it would only add to her depression if she learned it, so why bother? Let her enjoy this one odd thing. It won&#x2019;t last forever. Nothing does.<br> After making note of today&#x2019;s appearance, she returns to the kitchen to refill her coffee and focus on other things, like what Wyatt wants for dinner tonight, and whether he&#x2019;s going to watch the remaining episodes of Game of Thrones with her, or if she should go ahead and knock them out herself. Ah, the glamorous life. He&#x2019;s currently slurping down a bowl of cereal, and the sound immediately grates on her nerves. Has he always done that, or is she just now starting to notice it after ten years? <br> She&#x2019;s discovered several other micro-habits of his lately that make her fantasize about bludgeoning him with an iron skillet like an old-fashioned cartoon wife. For instance, when he pretends he&#x2019;s about to laugh right after he says something passive-aggressive, which seems to be every other sentence that leaves his mouth these days. Or the way he licks his finger every time he turns a page in a magazine; Phoebe is certain she can now hear the grating of his tongue against the ridges of his fingertips, and she has to leave the room as soon as she sees him going for his Newsweek or Rolling Stone. In a more clichï¿½ man move, he has also started leaving his hair in their bathroom sink after he cleans out his electric razor. But of all the ways her husband has found to grind her gears, she&#x2019;s sure it&#x2019;s the disgusting racket of his slurping, crunching, and tearing into his every meal that will finally send her over the edge. She recently read about a study linking a sensitivity to eating sounds to a higher IQ. Phoebe is sure she now qualifies for a Mensa membership.<br> She soothes herself with a simple thought. In just a few minutes, he will be off to work. Blessed silence will soon wrap around her like a fuzzy blanket, at which point she&#x2019;ll lock all the doors, arm the security system, and return to bed, spreading her arms and legs wide across both sides like a starfish. Sometime around noon, she will get up, put on her bathing suit, and bring a book and a bottle of wine poolside. Two hours before Wyatt comes home from work, she will put on actual clothes and brush her hair, trying to ignore the outgrown roots and the split ends that have cropped up over the months since she last visited a salon. She&#x2019;ll dab on a little makeup, hoping to hide the deepening lines around her eyes and brighten her increasingly sallow complexion. She will put on clothes that have a bit of extra stretch in them to accommodate her ever-widening rear end.<br> She can&#x2019;t recall suddenly letting herself go. It feels like more of a gradual surrender. Even two years ago, she wouldn&#x2019;t have thought twice about spending hours in the salon, or covering herself in dozens of expensive serums and creams designed to make women think they can roll back the miles on the odometer. She vividly recalls spending two or three hours a day in the gym, while partaking in whatever fad diet promised to keep the dreaded muffin top at bay if she just avoided this One Newly Reviled Ingredient. That pampered cream-puff version of herself hadn&#x2019;t yet succumbed to several failed fertility treatments. She also hadn&#x2019;t watched the father she&#x2019;d spent most of her life fearing, hating, and loving in painfully equal measure die so rapidly of pancreatic cancer that he&#x2019;d had no time to leave her with any of the closure or apologies he&#x2019;d surely spent his whole life hoping to gift her.<br> Now, in the aftermath of Daniel&#x2019;s death, she more closely resembles an actual cream puff&#x2014;pale, a bit round, only a whole lot less sweet. That&#x2019;s mostly thanks to the fertility hormones that wreaked havoc on her system, but the daily ice cream and booze regimen isn&#x2019;t helping. Some good has come from this transition, however. For instance, she&#x2019;s rediscovered the grace in being childless, and how it affords limitless opportunities for poolside reading and day drinking. She has also found nirvana in wearing yoga pants with no intention of doing poses, peace in ignoring ingredient lists, calories, and macro counts. Her favorite synonym for serenity is French: cabernet sauvignon.<br> She also embraces the quiet ease of a shut-in lifestyle, where all incoming calls are sent to the oubliette of an overflowing voicemail box, where her father&#x2019;s misdeeds are just a headline she scrolls by in search of another mindless quiz that promises to tell her what kind of cheese she is (gouda) or which country she should have been born in (Switzerland, neutrally). Daniel Noble may be the source of the trust fund that affords her this life, but she isn&#x2019;t responsible for the man himself. She considers the family fortune a well-earned restitution for having to grow up with the bastard.<br> Wyatt doesn&#x2019;t seem to have noticed this quiet evolution of his wife, or if he has, he&#x2019;s choosing to ignore it. Despite knowing she&#x2019;s given up the fertility treatments, he&#x2019;s still asking her if she&#x2019;s ovulating before sex, a question that would hobble any normal person&#x2019;s libido at the starting line.<br> After he finishes his breakfast, he rinses his bowl and places it in the dishwasher. At least he still has a few good habits. But he doesn&#x2019;t pick up his keys. Instead, he comes back to the table. &#x201c;My first appointment isn&#x2019;t until ten. Want to sit out back for a bit?&#x201d;<br> She hesitates. This is aberrant. Even when he has extra time in the morning, he usually spends it at the office catching up on paperwork. He must want to discuss something, which is a guarantee they&#x2019;ll end up in a petty argument of some sort. But the faster they get through whatever is on his mind, the sooner she can have her blessed solitude. She nods and follows him outside, where she sits on one of the long couches.<br> Their covered porch has nicer furniture than most people&#x2019;s houses, complete with a full kitchen, bar, and integrated stereo system. Propane heaters placed around the perimeter ensure they can use the space late into autumn if they want, but usually she covers everything back here in October. This would have made her sad once, but now she&#x2019;s looking forward to winter, when Chicago&#x2019;s famously miserable cold and snow will provide a much more natural barricade to going out into the world.<br> Wyatt has his briefcase with him, which makes him look more like a trial lawyer than someone who relays platitudes and affirmations to menopausal divorcees and stressed-out bankers who can&#x2019;t get it up anymore. Upon closer inspection, his shirt looks new and pressed, and she&#x2019;s never seen that tie before. Phoebe also notices his neatly groomed hair, combed and carefully smoothed with one of the many tubes of product she&#x2019;s bought him over the years that mostly go unused. His baby-smooth face hints that he shaved with a blade rather than an electric razor. For some reason, he wants to look good this morning, and Phoebe doesn&#x2019;t like it.<br> He&#x2019;s handsome in the classic sense. Strong jaw, dark hair, and eyes with lashes so thick he almost looks like he&#x2019;s wearing eyeliner. Those eyes attracted her in the very beginning when they locked drunken gazes at a mutual friend&#x2019;s Super Bowl party back in their Northwestern years. In those days&#x2014;nearly fifteen years ago now, she shudders to think&#x2014;good looks were all it took to get her heart pumping for just about any guy. But it was Wyatt&#x2019;s combination of brains, sense of humor, and taste for mischief that made her come back for a second date, and countless others after that. So long ago now are those days of clandestine sex in public places, crashing parties, and racing his old Mitsubishi Eclipse along Lower Wacker in the middle of the night while passing a small joint between them, that sometimes it&#x2019;s only those eyes that remind her he&#x2019;s the same rebellion against all of Daniel Noble&#x2019;s prerequisites for a son-in-law. A middle-class guy who had enough smarts and ambition to get into a prestigious school like Northwestern, but never got all the way to his PhD.<br> &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s time for us to consider next steps,&#x201d; he says, sitting next to her. His tone is hard to read, but there&#x2019;s the barest quaver in his voice, like he&#x2019;s nervous. She feels a bit of that in her own gut, too, but it&#x2019;s time they acknowledge this deep chill between them, which dates back to long before Daniel&#x2019;s death and the drama that&#x2019;s followed on its heels.<br> She thinks immediately of their four failed in vitro attempts, but she knows it goes back even further, to the reason they got married in the first place: an unexpected plus sign in the result window of a drugstore pregnancy test. Heavily under the influence of romance and freshly surging pregnancy hormones, Phoebe considered an abortion for all of thirty seconds before swiping away the idea for something much shinier: a chance at respectability befitting her family name. A handsome husband, a beautiful home in the suburbs, and a brand new baby to tie it all together. They decided on a spontaneous civil ceremony at the Cook County courthouse. It would have horrified her mother had she still been alive, but Daniel seemed happy to avoid the expense, especially given his ambivalent-at-best feelings about the groom. He accepted the news about a coming grandchild with little reaction but did seem to warm a bit when he learned it was going to be a boy.<br> Unfortunately, the attempt at living the domestic bliss her mother had dreamed of for her never got off the launchpad. Their son, Xavier Thomas Miller, was stillborn at twenty-eight weeks. He has a tiny grave she hasn&#x2019;t mustered the steam to visit since the day of the short, quiet ceremony that only she and Wyatt attended.<br> Despite the loss, they went on okay for a few years after that. Wyatt got his counselor&#x2019;s license and started up his therapy practice. Phoebe dabbled in work with her father&#x2019;s company. They also did the sorts of things couples untethered by kids and financial stress do: travel, concerts, trying on temporary new hobbies before ultimately discarding them, like Wyatt&#x2019;s obsession with brewing his own beer, and Phoebe&#x2019;s more expensive forays into modern art collecting and photography. But as they approached their thirties, the unspoken question of whether they should try again to start a family began to grow louder, and Wyatt finally asked it over carpaccio and cocktails while celebrating their eighth anniversary at Francesca&#x2019;s, their favorite local Italian haunt. Maybe it was the wine warming her blood or the flicker of candlelight in his eyes, but she felt open enough to at least stop taking her birth control pills ...</p><h2>WAR IN 2020</h2><p>With the Soviet Union crumbling under internal pressures and a new Japanese empire causing trouble around the globe, the world is in chaos, and the Americans find themselves joining forces with their old enemies in Moscow</p><p>A plague sweeps out of Africa to decimate the world's population. An American expeditionary force is humiliated by South Africans armed with a new generation of Japanese weapons. Israel is destroyed in a nuclear exchange. These apocalyptic events are only background in Peters's ( Red Army ) latest page-turner. To aid a disintegrating Soviet Union being overrun by a Japanese-supported Islamic army, America intervenes with the Seventh Cavalry, commanded by living legend Col. George Taylor and equipped with the top-secret M-100 super helicopter. Japan responds with the Scrambler, a neurological weapon so horrible it frightens even its users. But the Seventh has an electronic surprise of its own in this high-tech thriller that verges on science fiction. Although Peters risks offense with his portrayal of Muslims as bloodthirsty savages, he keeps firm control of the story as it speeds from Africa to Mexico to the steppes of Russia, and his understated style effectively conveys the grim nature of soldiering in "twilight wars."

The war in this novel is being fought by an Islamic-Japanese axis, which has attacked a post-Gorbachev Soviet Union weakened by a devastating civil war. Enter the Americans on the side of the Soviets; enter, too, the larger-than-life heroic figure of Colonel George Taylor, who commands a computerized aerial strike force called the U.S. 7th Cavalry. It should be noted that by 2020 the "final" Mideast War has been fought and surviving Israelis have been resettled in "homelands located in the least promising area of the Far West." Peters, an Army intelligence officer, writes believably of high-tech warfare, but the fighters are real people. Recommended.

Born in New Zealand, she was living in Marseille and was married to Frenchman Henri Fiocca when the Germans invaded. Nancy immediately became active in the Resistance movement, smuggling messages and food to underground groups in Southern France and helping refugees flee to Spain. By 1943 she was on the Gestapo most-wanted list. Their nickname for her, due to her elusiveness, was the "White Mouse." It was time for Nancy to leave France. After six escape attempts Nancy reached Britain&#x2014;where she promptly became one of the&nbsp;39 women to join the British Special Operations Executive. Parachuted back into France, she became the virtual leader of a 7,000-strong branch of the Maquis. This book tells the extraordinary story of this exceptional woman.</p><p>Russell Braddon was imprisoned in Changi for four years during World War II.

The collection's common theme is a focus on sites, how we see them and what we derive from that looking. Acknowledging that even the most modest landscape encounter has validity, Hunt contends that the more one knows about a site and one's own sight of it (an awareness of how one is seeing), the greater the insight. Employing the concepts, tropes, and rhetorical methods of literary analysis, he addresses the problem of how to discuss, understand, and appreciate places that are experienced through all the senses, over time and through space.</p><p>Hunt questions our intellectual and aesthetic understanding of gardens and designed landscapes and asks how these sites affect us emotionally. Do gardens have meaning? When we visit a fine garden or designed landscape, we experience a unique work of great complexity in purpose, which has been executed over a number of years&#x2014;a work that, occasionally, achieves beauty. While direct experience is fundamental, Hunt demonstrates how the ways in which gardens and landscapes are communicated in word and image can be equally important. He returns frequently to a cluster of key sites and writings on which he has based much of his thinking about garden-making and its role in landscape architecture: the gardens of Rousham in Oxfordshire; Thomas Whately's <i>Observations on Modern Gardening</i> (1770); William Gilpin's dialogues on Stowe (1747); Alexander Pope's meditation on <i>genius loci</i>; the Dï¿½sert de Retz; Paolo Burgi's Cardada; and the designs by Bernard Lassus and Ian Hamilton Finlay.</p></p><p>John Dixon Hunt is Emeritus Professor of the History and Theory of Landscape, University of Pennsylvania. Among his numerous books are The Afterlife of Gardens and Garden and Grove: The Italian Renaissance Garden in the English Imagination, 1600-1750, both published by the University of Pennsylvania Press.<p>Foreword<br>Peter Walker and Jane Brown Gillette</p><p>We share with John Dixon Hunt a love of gardens, current and historic, in perfection and decay. We like to experience them in various seasons and times of day, to contemplate and enjoy and assess their artistry. We also like to discuss and criticize them and read and write about them. We do this, of course, from quite different points of view. John loves to be in gardens, as do many of us who design and build them. But John brings to his visits a critical, informed eye that is founded on his background in literary and art history, and it is this difference that makes him so valuable to the field of landscape architecture.</p><p>In one essay in this collection John describes a pivotal moment in his career. At an IFLA conference in 1992 he expressed the thought that he might become a landscape architect, and Pete, presumably, shouted "from the rear of the hall . . . (something like) 'No, no; go on doing what you do.'" Pete Walker must admit that he has no memory of making this statement, but John's book of essays proves that that advice, whether his or not, was wise. Landscape architects need garden historians.</p><p>Over the years, the field of landscape architecture has enjoyed little critical discourse compared to architecture, planning, and the other visual and environmental arts. For the most part we have focused our critical energies on either ecological or planning issues with little attention to the design and art and significance of gardens and other cultural landscapes&#x2014;which, as is the case with any other craft, can only be lifted to their highest possibilities through intelligent criticism and a thorough understanding of their historical backgrounds. Unfortunately landscape education today is particularly weak in design criticism and history, as opposed to what we call theory, a variety of discourse seldom put in its historical context and thus frequently serving, at best, as an offshoot of advertising even as its academic voice grows louder. Meanwhile most landscape architecture students are lucky to receive a single history course, which is rarely taught by a trained historian. Occasionally, this course is augmented by a random architectural or art history course with little or no defined relationship to the practice and history of landscape architecture.</p><p>When we visit a fine garden or designed landscape, we experience a unique work of great complexity in purpose, which has been executed over a number of years&#x2014;a work that, occasionally, achieves beauty. Such landscapes contain built structure, living plants, and water, all with the ability to express, exploit, and sustain the changes and impacts of the natural elements through time. A creation of such complexity is all too frequently invisible to the general public (and to many professionals) without an explanation derived from a critical discourse that relates it to other elements of cultural endeavor, some genre related, some historical. This discourse can certainly include and be enriched by designers, but we are not trained historians or critical theoreticians and frequently lack the wide-reaching literacy that informs such professions.</p><p>The importance of this literacy can be evidenced by many examples in <i>Site, Sight, Insight</i>, but one must suffice. Throughout the essays John gives voice to a pervasive concern with our intellectual and aesthetic understanding of gardens: How do they affect us emotionally? Do they have "meaning"? What does "meaning" mean? Couldn't "meaning" more accurately be called "significance"? In these essays, initially published in a wide range of venues, John is particularly adept at discussing the issue of significance as it relates to subjects like follies, ekphrasis, bridges, and memory, as well as site-specific expressions at Stourhead and a host of other gardens. He states the problem and suggests a solution, and he shows a profound humanity in his willingness to end his argument in inconclusiveness, in possibility, in an indeterminate state so difficult for most of us to accept. John points to a solution to the problem of "meaning" in his essay on Stourhead: maybe we understand the garden in a way that corresponds to the eighteenth-century belief in "association," notably put forth in the philosophy of John Locke. According to this theory of human psychology, a garden&#x2014;rather than the exposition of a single "meaning"&#x2014;inspires a variety of associations from each of us when we visit its confines. In later essays John also points to the problem of free association: if everything in a garden can mean anything, doesn't significance of any importance evaporate? In the face of this problem, John expresses a desire for a core of learning that would shape our associations, learning that can only come from the study of form and history and critical rhetoric, a sort of common understanding and perception shaped by sophisticated perception and knowledge. In other words, we would abandon the exposition of one "meaning" in a landscape for a significance that comes about from a flow of informed associations. Such an approach to significance would require a careful examination of the physical landscape and much historical education, not only for landscape architects but for the public in general. Indeed, such an approach might even call for undergraduate courses in landscape history and a recognition that, like literary history and art history and social history, the history of gardens is a necessary part of the liberal arts education.</p><p>This one example of John's ability to state a problem and find a solution shows why we both have such a deep appreciation of his broad and scholarly point of view. We continue to profit from his energetic work in teaching, writing, and expanding publications pertinent to our understanding and practice of design.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Preface</p><p>This collection brings together some of my recent writings on landscape architecture. Its common theme is a focus on sites, on how we see them and on what we derive from that looking. They reprise other sites about which I have written elsewhere, and they also allow some cross-references, even some overlaps, between the essays, since I have been pursuing these themes for some time, and certain topics recur on different occasions for different purposes. So I return frequently to a cluster of key sites and writings, upon which I have based much of my thinking about garden making and its role in landscape architecture: the gardens of Rousham in Oxfordshire, Thomas Whately's <i>Observations on Modern Gardening</i> (1770), William Gilpin's dialogue on Stowe (1747), Alexander Pope's meditation on genius loci, and sites like the Dï¿½sert de Retz, Paolo Burgi's Cardada, and several designs by Bernard Lassus and Ian Hamilton Finlay.</p><p>Six of these essays are published here for the first time, the remainder, most of which originally appeared in publications where those interested in landscape architecture are less likely to look, have all been significantly revised. The one piece which I have barely changed, but to which I have now added some images, is the essay on the meaning of Stourhead that was first published in the journal that I have edited since its inception in 1981. I like to think it is one of the more useful pieces I have written, as it tackles the tricky issue of how we today read historical gardens, a topic that I feel still needs to be aired, and it endorses what I had taken up two years earlier in <i>The Afterlife of Gardens</i> (2004). Otherwise, the essays are versions of talks given in Portugal, Paris, Versailles, and London, and in graduate seminars at Penn that circle around the topics of site, sight, and insight; that on "ARCH" borrows a small segment of a piece that I wrote for the festschrift for Michael Seiler, <i>Wege zum Garten</i> (Potsdam, 2004). I have not attempted to "flatten" out these different talks and essays, but leave each to address a different audience. Finally, I have added a postscript to answer the question I am often asked&#x2014;why did you move from literature to landscape? I never have enough time to explain why, or what the benefits of such an academic transition might be, so I offer it here.</p><p>Warm thanks for contributing their foreword are due to Peter Walker, a distinguished landscape architect, and Jane Brown Gillette, a wonderful writer, whose path crossed mine when I was teaching English at Vassar College years ago.</p><p>I acknowledge good advice, as always, from Michael Leslie and Edward Harwood on some of these collected essays, as well as comments from an anonymous reader.</p></p><h2>Vincent By Himself</h2><p>This unique compilation of the art and writings of Vincent Van Gogh vividly conveys the intelligence and genius of one of Europe&#39;s greatest artists. The unquestionable appeal of Vincent&#39;s paintings and drawings is enhanced by his own account of his life and thought, as contained in his letters. This selection includes more than 230 of his paintings and drawings - all reproduced in full color - as well as extracts of the artist&#39;s correspondence to friends and family members.</p><p></p><h2>The Moonlit Garden</h2><p>In <i>The Moonlit Garden</i>, Scott Ogden introduces readers to the wonder of the evening garden. Written with charm and elegance, this book will appeal to those whose gardens are a source of intellectual stimulation as well as physical beauty and repose.</p><p>Plantsman and naturalist Scott Ogden writes in loving depth about Southern gardens, including the flora (and sometimes fauna) that inhabits the hills of central Texas where he makes his home. In <i>The Moonlit Garden</i>, Ogden focuses on the flowers of the night, their presence, their perfumes, and their pollinators. He invites us into the night garden, where luminous flowers gleam by star or moonlight. An early section introduces the underlying concepts that affect garden design--particularly the placement of paths, seats, and architectural structures--when our object is nocturnal enjoyment. Ogden begins in the garden, but soon branches out into a range of settings: desert and prairie, tropical and temperate forests, mountain meadow, pond and riverside. He introduces a host of night-blooming plants from each habitat, emphasizing those suitable for garden placement. Though his garden is in USDA zone 8, many of his selections travel well, and could be grown almost anywhere. A final section discusses garden illumination; not surprisingly, Ogden favors the eerie glow of the limestone <i>tai-hu</i> rocks beloved of Chinese gardeners. He warns that excess light--artificial or created by lanterns--can spoil the magic of the garden in the dark. <i>--Ann Lovejoy</i>Scott Odgen has become one of the most prolific garden writers. This is a book written from the heart of an articulate, intelligent man who just happens to be a gardnener for anyone who just likes a good book to read or garden.

In this 1923 classic, the first book ever written about the public relations industry, he delineates the approaches that corporations and governments have taken for the past century to influence social tendencies.<br><i>Crystallizing Public Opinion</i> identifies the techniques employed by public relations professionals, from authoritative-sounding surveys to persuasive endorsements from opinion leaders, celebrities, and experts. Bernays &#x2014; whose high-profile clients included Procter &amp; Gamble, General Electric, CBS, NBC, and Time, Inc. &#x2014; cites examples from his successful campaigns, including a physician-endorsed promotion of bacon as a healthy breakfast option. He quotes leading theorists on the role of herd mentality in the minds of the educated as well as the ignorant, and he explains the value of communicating the right facts at the right time to a targeted audience. Although technology has changed in the years since this book's debut, human nature has not, and these principles remain of timeless value to business and marketing professionals, students of public relations, and other readers.</p><p>Edward Bernays (1891&#x2013;1995) was a pioneer in the field of public relations who emigrated from his native Austria to the United States in the 1930s. During his career in public relations, Bernays devised and popularized many techniques for influencing public opinion on behalf of a huge roster of clients that included many corporations and industrial organizations, governments around the world, and advocacy groups in many fields. "Public relations, effectively used, helps validate an underlying principle of our society &#x2014; competition in the market place of ideas and things," he wrote in 1971.</p><h2>Oil and Honey: The Education of an Unlikely Activist</h2><p><p><b>Bestselling author and environmental activist Bill McKibben recounts the personal and global story of the fight to build and preserve a sustainable planet</b></p><p>Bill McKibben is not a person you'd expect to find handcuffed and behind bars, but that's where he found himself in the summer of 2011 after leading the largest civil disobedience in thirty years, protesting the Keystone XL pipeline in front of the White House.</p><p>With the Arctic melting, the Midwest in drought, and Irene scouring the Atlantic, McKibben recognized that action was needed if solutions were to be found. Some of those would come at the local level, where McKibben joins forces with a Vermont beekeeper raising his hives as part of the growing trend toward local food. Other solutions would come from a much larger fight against the fossil-fuel industry as a whole.</p><p><i>Oil and Honey</i> is McKibben's account of these two necessary and mutually reinforcing sides of the global climate fight&#x2015;from the center of the maelstrom and from the growing hive of small-scale local answers to climate change. With empathy and passion he makes the case for a renewed commitment on both levels of the fight to stop global warming, telling the story of raising one year's honey crop and building a social movement that's still cresting.</p></p><p><b>Bill McKibben</b> is the author of more than a dozen books, including <i>The End of Nature</i>, <i>Eaarth</i>, and <i>Deep Economy</i>. He is the founder of the environmental organization 350.org and was among the first to warn of the dangers of global warming. He is the Schumann Distinguished Scholar at Middlebury College, a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the 2013 winner of the Gandhi Peace Award.<p>1<br>Two Lives</p> <p>Here&#x2019;s a story of two lives lived in response to a crazy time&#x2014;a time when the Arctic melted and the temperature soared, a time when the planet began to come apart, a time when bee populations suddenly dropped in half. Each story is extreme. They&#x2019;re not intended as suggestions for how others should live, and I hope the reader won&#x2019;t feel the need to choose, or reject, either one. Each story is mine, at least in part, for sometimes I think I&#x2019;ve learned more in the past two years than in all the decades that came before. Some of that education came in the tumult and conflict of my own life, as I helped to build an active resistance to the fossil fuel industry. And some came in the beeyards of my home state, while I carefully watched a very different, very beautiful way of dealing with a malfunctioning modernity. These stories mesh together, I hope: awkwardly right now, but perhaps, with luck, more easily in the time to come.</p> <p>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022;</p> <p>I first met Kirk Webster in the fall of 2001. Newly ensconced at Middlebury College in Vermont, I&#x2019;d offered to teach a course on local food production. There were two problems. One, I can&#x2019;t really grow anything&#x2014;my heart is green, but not my thumb. Two, this was long before Michael Pollan or Barbara Kingsolver had taken up local agriculture, and there wasn&#x2019;t really much to read. We could choose among the remarkable essays of Wendell Berry, the seductive novels of Wendell Berry, and the tough poems of Wendell Berry. Looking through back issues of a magazine called <i>Small Farmer&#x2019;s Journal</i>, however, I came across an essay by a beekeeper named Kirk Webster. I&#x2019;m not sure I noticed, the first time I read it, that he was a neighbor. I was just taken by his confident prose and his descriptions of his life among the honeybees.</p> <p>&#x201c;Surely the best kept secret in the U.S. today is the wonderful way of life that&#x2019;s possible with full-time farming on a small place,&#x201d; he began. &#x201c;If more people understood the opportunities for faith, freedom, responsibility, health and education that good farming can provide, our rural areas might be repopulated and the self-destructive course of our society reversed. This timeless activity is so much more than just a way of making a living&#x2014;it is in fact the Middle Path described in the Buddha&#x2019;s teachings and the object of St. Thomas&#x2019;s words: &#x2018;The kingdom of heaven surrounds you, but you see it not.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p> <p>He was, it turned out, living in the next town over, and easy to track down via the small-farmer grapevine; he agreed to come to class and talk. I don&#x2019;t recall everything he said that day, but I do remember my first impression: he was bearded, shy, and a little ill at ease, but we all took to him instantly. Even the students who had no intention of becoming farmers&#x2014;the ones bound for finance or medicine or the other high-powered careers you leave for from a place like Middlebury&#x2014;were shaken a little by his quiet resolution, and by his story.</p> <p>He&#x2019;d grown up in suburban New Jersey (like many of them), in a family he described in his essay as &#x201c;largely dysfunctional and aimless&#x201d; (so, not unlike a lot of them). &#x201c;I always liked to read, and I didn&#x2019;t have trouble getting good grades, so everyone assumed I would be able to get scholarships and somehow continue as far as possible with &#x2018;education.&#x2019; &#x201d; By the age of fifteen, though, &#x201c;it was clear that I was soon going to seek elsewhere for something to do in my life.&#x201d; Nature and the outdoors world had become an &#x201c;irresistible magnet,&#x201d; and so in order that he earn some kind of diploma his parents sent him to the Mountain School in farm country Vermont, a rural outpost that grew its own food and cut its own firewood, and where he was all but adopted by one of the families whose parents taught at the school. Bill and Martha Treichler, and their boys and girls, taught him how to garden and to build and to do the hundreds of other jobs of rural self-sufficiency; he suddenly had a model that made sense&#x2014;a joyful and tight farm family who were living outside the normal economy.</p> <p>&#x201c;One evening, just before dinner in the noisy school dining hall,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;Bill told me that the year their fifth child was born, the family&#x2019;s gross income was $600. I almost dropped the pitcher of milk I was holding. The sights and sounds in the room started to spin, and I felt like someone had just hit me right between the eyes with a stick of cordwood. Here were the most capable, healthiest, and best educated people I had ever met, who with five young children at home, had chosen a way of life with only $600 of cash income (perhaps equivalent to $2,400 today). They certainly could have pursued any number of jobs or careers to make a normal income, but chose instead to be together as a family and pick and choose carefully which aspects of the larger society they would get involved with. Farming and healthy self-sufficient living in a debt-free situation allowed them to do this. In that moment in the dining hall, all of my developing notions of making a living, security, jobs and careers were shattered, and I knew I would have to start again in learning what these things really mean.&#x201d;</p> <p>That moment ramified. When he was wracked up in a toboggan accident that winter, someone gave him a book on beekeeping, and it captured his imagination; home on vacation in New Jersey he found an octogenarian Ukrainian immigrant who needed help with his hives. That man told him about another&#x2014;Charlie Mraz, in Vermont&#x2019;s Champlain Valley, and when Kirk returned to school he hitchhiked across the state to ask the veteran apiarist for a job. He worked there for two years after high school, eating meals with the family but sleeping in the honey house. And then, still a very young man, he struck off across the country, working on a variety of farms and doing carpentry to pay his bills. Everywhere he went he built up small apiaries, honing his skills, and in the fall of 1985 he returned to the Champlain Valley and began his life&#x2019;s work, raising bees and selling colonies, queens, and honey. Slowly, patiently, and in the face of growing problems with mites that were decimating many apiaries, he built his business into a going concern, pioneering a number of new techniques and becoming one of the very few beekeepers in the country who made a living without using chemicals in his hives. It was a decent living, too&#x2014;when he came to my class that day, he bought his books with him, and showed us that Champlain Valley Bees and Queens, Inc., was grossing $50,000 a year, of which about half netted out. &#x201c;After living, and enjoying life, for so long with so little money, this frankly seems like an enormous fortune to me,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;In terms of the American greedy lifestyle, it&#x2019;s still not very much money. But I consider it to be a more than ample reward for the independence, the wonderful way of life, and the chance to live apart from a predatory society that beekeeping and farming provide.&#x201d;</p> <p>He was, in other words, leading a somewhat Amish life, with the obvious exception that he wasn&#x2019;t surrounded by an Amish community where everyone else was living likewise. There are other small farmers in the valley, and they were his friends; nonetheless, he was, perhaps, a little lonely&#x2014;more on that later. But the deeper problem went like this: he thought his farming wouldn&#x2019;t truly matter until he could pass on what he&#x2019;d learned. &#x201c;If there are young people anymore, interested in beekeeping, I&#x2019;d like to have a few of them come here to learn the trade,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;This is still in the planning stage, but it should be possible to expand the apiary enough to support one or two apprentices, then spin off the excess bees as the young folks return home to start propagating bees and producing honey on their own. If even one or two full-time apiaries resulted from this process, I&#x2019;d be able to at least approach my own definition of successful farming.&#x201d;</p> <p>As the decade wore on, I&#x2019;d see Kirk now and again&#x2014;have him over for dinner or meet him for a cross-country ski. And so I knew he was shepherding his apiary through the most difficult decade in beekeeping history, surviving everything from the colony collapse disorder that killed so many beehives to the flood of cheap (and adulterated) Chinese honey that threatened to wreck the market. He&#x2019;d continued to follow his unorthodox route. Instead of trucking his bees to California, like most apiarists, to cash in on the almond pollination season, he kept them close to home all year round, and worked diligently to rid his apiary of all trace of chemicals. And it had worked&#x2014;but not well enough for him to take on the apprentices he&#x2019;d wanted. He had no farm of his own, so he lived in a rented home on a small patch of land and had his shop nearby; his colonies were, as with most apiaries, spread out at a dozen locations around the valley. It all worked, but there was no room for young people to come, stay, and learn. And there was no land to make the apiary the hub of something even sweeter, a small farm with crops and animals. Had he lived some other place, he could have done it, but the cost of land in Vermont is unnaturally high&#x2014;New York and Boston are within driving distance, and so prices get set less by what a farmer can earn than by what a stockbroker can afford.</p> <p>It became clear to me that the moment was passing&#x2014;Kirk is strong and healthy, but he&#x2019;s got another decade at his peak, I&#x2019;d guess. If he was going to pass on what he knew, the time was ripe. And I, too, felt a strong urge to have a more-than-theoretical connection to the landscape and the emerging local economy that I was writing so much about. So I made him a proposal: What if I buy you a piece of land and grant you free lifetime tenure on it? In return, you build the farm buildings and get the land working, and pay the insurance and taxes. By any global standard, I&#x2019;m a rich man. But I&#x2019;m not in the class of people who buy farms willy-nilly. Still, I&#x2019;ve always wanted something tangible to leave my daughter; since Kirk and I are about the same age, she should be the ultimate beneficiary, inheriting the operation when Kirk died. Given what I knew about climate change, the gift of productive land seemed like the best thing I could hope to pass on to her, an insurance policy worth more than money in some account. In the meantime, Kirk could fulfill his farming destiny.</p> <p>Kirk agreed, and I went looking for the money&#x2014;as it turns out, the check for this book covered the down payment. And together we started the search for land, wandering one property after another. There was no shortage of possibilities&#x2014;every month a few more dairy farms disappear, done in by the low price of commodity milk and the impossibility of competing with the giant ten-thousand-head megadairies of the West. We looked at many, but they were hard worn, their outbuildings crumbling after a few decades of cash-strapped deferred maintenance. We eventually checked in with the Vermont Land Trust, which has been conserving farmland around the state for decades. (It works like this: a farmer decides that instead of selling off his land in lots for vacation homes, he&#x2019;ll sell the development rights to VLT; he can keep farming, and the land will stay intact.) VLT connected us with a farmer who wanted to unload&#x2014;after selling his development rights he&#x2019;d gotten sick of the entire farming business altogether and moved on to California, and now his seventy-acre parcel outside the town of New Haven was just sitting there. There was a driveway and one double-wide trailer. The land was pretty near the geographic center of Kirk&#x2019;s various beeyards around the county, and when we tested the well the water flowed pretty well. With the great help of our lawyer friend Dick Foote we managed finally to settle the deal. The farm wasn&#x2019;t especially picturesque&#x2014;the neighbor directly to the west ran a noisy excavating business, and the fields were rimmed with scrubby sumac. But some of the soil was rich loam, not the standard Champlain Valley clay. And the woodlot was plenty large enough to keep Kirk in firewood forever. We both knew it was the place.</p> <p>The double-wide would serve for the someday apprentices; the first order of business, in that spring of 2011, was to get a barn built, and then, if his money held out, a small farmhouse, where Kirk was pretty sure he&#x2019;d spend the rest of his life. This new operation would not change the world, both of us knew that. But it would, you know, change the world. The sum total of a million of these kind of small shifts would be a different civilization, one you could just begin to sense emerging as farmer&#x2019;s markets spread across the nation. The U.S. Department of Agriculture had just announced a seismic demographic shift: For the first time in 150 years the number of farms in America was no longer falling. In fact, over the past half decade, it had begun inexorably to rise. All the growth was coming at the small end of the business, with people growing food for their neighbors. Vermont was a case in point: dairies continued to disappear, but we suddenly had neighbors growing wheat and barley&#x2014;the kind of crops we hadn&#x2019;t seen for a century in this state. The number of farmers in the United States was still small&#x2014;just 1 percent, or half the proportion of the population behind prison bars. But something had definitely begun to turn. Given enough time . . .</p> <p><br>Time, of course, was the trouble. Offered a century&#x2019;s grace, I have no doubt we could subside into a workable, even beautiful, civilization. But 2011, when Kirk and I bought the farm, was shaping up to be one of the warmest years on record. As that summer wore on, we saw record heat in the Southwest and a drought so deep it killed five hundred million trees in Texas. Meanwhile, there was record rainfall across the Mississippi Basin, and the river swelled so fast that the Army Corps of Engineers was blowing up levees and flooding farmland to try to save cities from inundation.</p> <p>Those were the facts of my life, those and a million other such stories and statistics. For twenty-five years&#x2014;almost my entire adulthood&#x2014;I&#x2019;d been working on what we first called the greenhouse effect, and then global warming, and then climate change. Back in 1989, when Kirk was building his first apiaries, I was writing my first book, which was also the first book on the topic for nonscientists. <i>The End of Nature</i> was a best seller, translated into a couple of dozen languages, and my initial theory (I was still in my twenties) was that people would read the book&#x2014;and then change.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s not quite how it happened, so I kept on writing, one book after another, about some aspect of this great crisis. I wrote articles, too, for just about every magazine you could name, and op-eds, and when blog posts became a thing I wrote those. I assumed, like most people, that reason would eventually prevail&#x2014;that given the loud alarm sounded by scientists, governments would take care of the problem. And for a while that seemed, fitfully, to be happening. I was in Kyoto in 1998 when the world&#x2019;s nations signed the first accord to staunch the flow of carbon dioxide, and I remember thinking that we&#x2019;d turned a corner. It was going to be close, I thought, but we were headed in the right direction.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s not quite how it happened, either. As it turned out, the United States never ratified the Kyoto accord, and soon China was building a coal plant a week. Carbon emissions kept soaring, and donations from the fossil fuel industry managed to turn one of our two political parties into climate deniers and the other party into cowards. Power, not reason, was ascendant, and writing yet another story about the latest scientific findings seemed less and less useful. By 2009, a decade after Kyoto, the U.S. Senate&#x2014;then with sixty Democrats&#x2014;was so scared of Big Oil that it wouldn&#x2019;t even take a vote on t...</p></p><h2>Immodest Acts: The Life of a Lesbian Nun in Renaissance Italy (Studies in the History of Sexuality)</h2><p>The discovery of the fascinating and richly documented story of Sister Benedetta Carlini, Abbess of the</p><p>Judith C.

Tour.</p><p>It only looked like the American Dream. When Commerce, Oklahoma, native Mickey Mantle, heir apparent to Joe DiMaggio, arrived in New York in 1951, Yankee manager Casey Stengel cautioned the press, "Go easy on the kid. He's never seen concrete." The press took Casey's advice, but the Mick didn't. Beginning with an introduction written by Mantle shortly before his death in 1995 and including contributions from Mantle's wife, Merlyn, and his three living sons, this memoir tells the whole sad story of an American hero's perpetual adolescence and the devastating effects it had on his family. Mickey's alcoholism--barely manageable in his playing years, out of control after--extended eventually to the entire family: Mick, Merlyn, and all four sons did time at the Betty Ford Center. We hear all the grisly details about the boozing and brawling and womanizing first from a contrite Mick and then from an ironic Merlyn and the shell-shocked boys. Somehow, though, this account never grates like a whiny talk-show confessional--<i>Oprah Does the Mantles</i>. What saves it is the stereotype-shattering voice of Merlyn, whose weary irony encompasses both love and anger. Her backstage voiceover, set against the dying Mick's genuine bafflement at how he could have screwed up something that looked so good, should echo in the ears of every American sports star. <i>Bill Ott</i>A poignant tribute to Mickey Mantle, the famed Yankee star who died of cancer last summer at age 64 following a failed liver transplant, this reminiscence presents alternating chapters by his widow and three of his sons; the fourth, 36-year-old Billy, died in 1994. The couple, both from the same small Oklahoma town, were married in 1951 and moved to New York City, a milieu that overwhelmed them. In due course they both developed serious drinking problems. The ballplayer was almost always on the road, either playing baseball or starring on the lecture circuit. He became an open womanizer, in two instances engaging in long-term affairs his wife was aware of. As the Mantle sons grew up, they became their father's drinking partners. All of them developed alcohol and/or drug addictions and were treated at the Betty Ford Clinic. Mickey is quoted here as saying he was a poor husband and father, an assessment readers will consider accurate, but his family expresses only love for him and recalls the qualities that endeared him to them.

Matt, an artist, and Lorna, a reluctant debutante from an entirely different milieu in class-bound prewar England, meet on a park bench, fall in love, and marry despite family consternation. Matt dies in the war, Lorna in childbirth, and the story moves to their daughter, and then to her daughter. One could quibble that Bailey sometimes fails to convey effectively the many shifts in the narrative indicated on the page by space breaks, which can make for some disorientation. Lively tends to use that white space to create a drama of what is not being said. In every other way, though, its a lovely production.

Read by Kaiser Wilhelm, both Roosevelts, other leaders. First paperback edition. 4 maps. 24 battle plans.</p><p>Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840-1914) was an American naval officer and lecturer. This highly influential volume, first published in 1890, contains Mahan&#39;s analysis and discussions of the factors leading to Britain&#39;s naval domination in the eighteenth century, with strategic and tactical recommendations based on these factors.<p>"Captain Mahan has written distinctively the best and most important, and also by far the most interesting, book on naval history which has been produced on either side of the water for many a long year." <br>--Atlantic Monthly <br>October 1890</p><p>First published over a century ago, this classic text on the history and tactics of naval warfare had a profound effect on the training of officers and the deployment of naval resources around the globe. Many of the world's great military strategists since 1890 have avidly read this book, including both Franklin Delano and Theodore Roosevelt, Kaiser Wilhelm II, and a host of admirals, chancellors, prime ministers, kings, and other presidents. It continues to be a primary reference for naval students and historians.</p><p>The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660-1783 presents the argument that, despite great changes and scientific advances in naval weaponry, certain principles of naval strategy remain constant. Beginning in the time of Alexander the Great, those nations with strong commercial and military command of the seas were the nations of greatest strength, wealth, and power. Though the determinants of military supremacy and the global balance of power have changed due to tremendous advances in technology, the principles and strategies discussed in the book remain creditable. The extensive presentation of the history of high-seas navigation alone makes this book an invaluable resource, as it has been credited with stimulating the growth of modern navies in leading countries of the world.</p><p>Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840-1914) served in the Civil War and twice served as the president of the United States Naval War College, beginning shortly after the college was founded. Mahan became known as one of the leading spokesmen for the age of American imperialism.

Water, that ubiquitous compound, is also quite a chemical and physical anomaly, as well as an essential ingredient for life. The book is a very simple and straightforward presentation of all of the wonders of water. Watson deals with not only the science behind waterits unique chemical and physical propertiesbut also delves into how our land and lives are shaped by the forces of water. The four sections, which relate water to the earth, to life, to science, and to history, are unique in their approach. The section on life and history should be of interest also to students of the social studies.

I found it an interesting read and in a similar vain to A Rifleman Went to War by h.w. mc bride. another book of similar ilk is With British Snipers to the Reich by c shore. all 3 books are interesting from their historical perspective --By k wedgwood<br><br>It would appear that this title has not been published since its first appearance in 1920; a great pity given its unique subject and the authors' expertise and experience in the field. Prior to the war, Hesketh-Prichard had been a big-game hunter, expert shot, cricketer, and travel author. He entered the army in 1914 and set about trying to improve the poor standard of British army sniping evident in France, eventually creating the "The First Army School of Sniping, Observing and Scouting (SOS)" which set the standard for sniping in France. In this very readable book, the author discusses his enthusiasm for sniping and the problems he encountered setting up such a school in a British army that had no `Establishment' (his words) for such a thing. Early on he describes seeing a sniper in action who was adamant he was putting every one of his bullets through the enemy's loop-hole at 600 yards with his telescopic rifle. Hesketh-Prichard observed through his own Ross telescope that they were consistently striking six feet to the left. This illustrates a common theme in the book, where `snipers' used telescopic rifles that weren't sighted in, were poorly maintained, and were used by untrained soldiers with little or no experience of stalking, using cover, or camouflage. The result was that the Germans had the upper hand and were causing appalling casualties. Hesketh-Prichard could see the benefit to unit morale of having truly expert snipers using specialist weapons, and successfully fought to teach this unique skill. The book discusses the early days, memories of both sniping and observing, the curriculum of the School, the training of the Portuguese, and includes two chapters illustrating the value of observation and information-gathering, `Wilibald The Hun' and "The Cat'. Following the book proper is three appendices that discuss the training of observers, the general teaching cource at the First Army School of SOS, and care of arms, range practice, patrolling and scouting, the stalking telescope, front line observation and reports, use of scouts, observers and snipers in attack, defence and open warfare, and the Enfield 1914 pattern `snipers rifle'. The text is leavened with a number of expert sketches and photographs illustrating points in the book, such as cover and camouflage, observation, etc. I did note several instances of lax proof-reading, limited to full stops in inappropriate places. These do not detract from what is a fine book written by a recognized expert in his field, and which is a joy to read. Very highly recommended. --By Tor Riley<br><br>This short book is obviously unique and covers more-or-less what you would expect. The read is, for the most part, pretty dry. There is a lot of information about the inter-service machinations that resulted in the establishment of the observation and sniping schools: who did what, and how the schools came about. I found this somewhat uninteresting. There is also material, of course, on what the schools taught, etc., and although this is interesting material, it is presented in a very dry manner--much of it as an appendix which is a schedule of the courses taught, broken down by day and hour, without details on the actual course of instruction. The actual observation and sniping anecdotes are very enjoyable, but also fairly infrequent, and a few of them are told twice to illustrate various viewpoints. I would stress that although the book is entitled "Sniping..." it would be more accurately entitled "Observation and Sniping..." If you're looking for a more-or-less historical perspective without much of the "action", and you don't mind the rather steep price, then this is the book for you. If you're more interested in the "war stories", then I'd suggest Herbert McBride's book instead. --By Clark B. Timmins</p><h2>Dew on the Thorn (Recovering the U.s.

The authors traveled by bus and burro through coastal villages and old colonial mining towns to seek out simple, robust country tables, weathered storage trunks, and sculptured sugar molds, pictured in 170 photos, 140 in full color.</p><p>Authors Karen Witynski and Joe P. Carr have spent years winding their way by bus and burro through coastal villages and old colonial mining towns, bumping alongside sugarcane fields and down narrow cobblestoned streets in search of simple, robust country tables, workbenches, storage trunks, corral gates, and old, heavy doors. They were intrigued by the diversity they encountered--the variety in style, design, and shape of utilitarian vessels and carved wooden objects. From milking stools shaped like animals to grain-measure boxes and sculptural sugar molds, the pieces were like mirrors reflecting a rich local history as well as the ingenuity of the hands that made them. From mesquite-carved beams and window lintels to jail doors and coffee mortars, Carr and Witynksi found new homes in the United States for their salvaged finds. Although artists and collectors have been enjoying and living with Mexican antiques and accents for decades, the last ten years have seen a meteoric rise in their popularity in every corner of the country. Carr and Witynski soon found that their customers were as intrigued as they were with these Mexican objects and shared their curiosity to know more about their origins. The result is Mexican Country Style, a showcase of the rich heritage of Mexican antiques.For decades, Mexico's countryside has startled visitors senses with the rich flavor of its tradition-bound world. Charmed by the character and ingenuity of the Mexican people, lovers of country style are irresistibly drawn to the rugged romantic beauty of the native architecture and the soulful antiquity of their handcrafted elements. The markings and textures that decades of time and wear have left on the indigenous furnishings and objects are character marks, alive with history, color, and personality.<br> Mexican Country Style is a celebration of this style's simple splendor, which is sweeping the country and making its way into the homes or offices of Jane Fonda and Ted Turner, Ralph Lauren, Val Kilmer, and Gene Hackman.<br> Nelson A. Rockefeller said of Mexico that "Its people have a love and understanding of the importance of the ordinary to the essential vitality of life. Instinctual, the mundane things made to carry out everyday acts, are all valuable and worthy of the greatest creative expression, (which is evident) in their lasting value and in the skill of their creators, their sense of sacredness of the routines of their daily lives."<br></p><h2>For Love of Evil (Incarnations of Immortality)</h2><p>Traces the life of Parry, a twelfth-century apprentice, from his humble beginnings to his ultimate position of twisted power in which he struggles with Lucifer for control of Hell</p><p>New York Times-bestselling author Piers Anthony has written over one hundred books.

Although it has often been translated, earlier versions do not give the reader the full sense of its oral epic nature as a song that came into being through a long tradition of sung performances before writing was widely practiced. When finally written down, it retained its oral-formulaic nature in ways that are clearly discernible, and which this translation successfully captures. Rodney Merrill strictly adheres to the use of dactylic hexameter, the meter by which the formulaic language of Homeric poetry is rendered as musical phrasing rather than as a simple repetition of ideas. Reading this version--especially aloud--will grant both students and teachers fresh insight into the nature of Greek epic and Homer's song about one of the most famous characters of all time.<br></p> <p>This epic began life as the music composed by a "singer of tales," not as words on a page. As such, its meter allows for pleasing variations with a strong basic "beat," thus providing a rhythmic impetus that carries the story swiftly forward. The resulting "music" has important repercussions for the reader's perception of the many repeated elements that provide structure for the poem and bring out significant themes, just as the repetitions in a piece of music do.<br></p> <p>This edition of the Odyssey includes selections for further reading, a list of proper names (with a guide to pronunciation), and three maps. It also provides introductory discussions of how the work came into being and was transmitted until it became the work we read, how it is divided into six "performance sessions" of four books each, and how the poem's various themes are developed. Rodney Merrill's Odyssey is thus an ideal edition for students, teachers, and general readers.<br></p> <p>The audiobook is available on twelve cassettes, and is read by Rodney Merrill. This version will bring Homer's epic masterpiece to life like never before. Perfect for the car or classroom!<br></p> <p>Rodney Merrill is retired and an independent scholar. He has taught at Stanford University, the University of San Francisco, and the University of California, Berkeley.<br></p> <p>Thomas R. Walsh, Senior Professor at Occidental College, has written articles on Homeric poetics, with a forthcoming book on anger in Homer.<br></p></p><p>Every library should own this wonderful translation of THE ODYSSEY. The introduction provides an overview of Greek verse and explains its rhythmic scheme. Rodney Merrill then launches into a performance that is as close as most listeners can get to hearing the poem in the original. Merrill's cadence is wonderful; he has a visceral understanding of how these lines are shaped for the ear, and he delivers them faithfully, with enthusiasm and love. He shifts tones occasionally to differentiate individual speakers but, for the most part, allows Homer's dominant voice to carry listeners on this mythic journey.

The decision was prompted largely by a series of articles in the <i>Winston-Salem Journal</i>. These stories were inspired in part by the research of Johanna Schoen, who was granted unique access to summaries of 7,500 case histories and the papers of the North Carolina Eugenics Board.<br><br>In this book, Schoen situates the state's reproductive politics in a national and global context. Widening her focus to include birth control, sterilization, and abortion policies across the nation, she demonstrates how each method for limiting unwanted pregnancies had the potential both to expand and to limit women's reproductive choices. Such programs overwhelmingly targeted poor and nonwhite populations, yet they also extended a measure of reproductive control to poor women that was previously out of reach.<br><br>On an international level, the United States has influenced reproductive health policies by, for example, tying foreign aid to the recipients' compliance with U.S. notions about family planning. The availability of U.S.-funded family planning aid has proved to be a double-edged sword, offering unprecedented opportunities to poor women while subjecting foreign patients to medical experimentation that would be considered unacceptable at home.<br><br>Drawing on the voices of health and science professionals, civic benefactors, and American women themselves, Schoen's study allows deeper understandings of the modern welfare state and the lives of women.<br><br></p><p>"Johanna Schoen's historical scholarship recovers the voices of poor women of color in the American South as active agents in determining their own sexuality and pregnancies. Schoen's story of poor women's negotiations with family planners, doctors, social workers and the state in mid-twentieth century North Carolina is riveting in itself. But the brilliance of this book is the deftness through which it links local particularities to a larger global context where birth control methods may be either liberating or controlling, depending on the dynamics of gender, race, class, and power."--Rosalind Pollack Petchesky, City University of New York <br>Based on unique access to more than 7,500 case histories and the papers of the North Carolina state eugenics board, Schoen looks at legislation, public health programs, and women&#39;s responses to sterilization, contraceptive use, and access to abortion from the 1920s to the 1970s.</p><h2>Dragon Age Vol. 1: The Silent Grove</h2><p><i>Dragon Age: The Silent Grove</i> is the perfect introduction to BioWare's dark fantasy universe!

H, Tawney at Kings College,London, in March and April 1922, but it is only now,more than three years later, that the work of preparing them for publication has been completed, andthat I have been called upon, as the chairman of the Holland Trustees, to introduce our first series of lectures to the public. They are a historical study ofthe religion of the Reformation in its bearing on socialand economic thought. We have been for many yearsfeeling our want of such a study, sufficiently documentedand grounded upon an adequate knowledge of the literature of the period, as we have watched the modernbattle between zealous medievalists impugning the Reformation as deeply responsible for the sins ofmodern industrialism, and no less zealous Protestantsrebutting the charge or throwing it back. At last, Ibelieve, we have got what is required, and that manybesides myself will find in the book a permanentsource of enlightenment and a just and well grounded judgment, I am thankful to feel that the first seriesof Holland lectures is a worthy tribute to the memory of a man who set his brilliant faculties to work in noix</p><p><p> <em>R.

Great events and seemingly trivial occurrences, technical developments and scientific achievements, war and disasters, and new beginnings, all unfold to display our century in its glory and grimness. A rich and lively display of Grass's extraordinary imagination, the 100 interlinked stories in this volume-one for each year from 1900 to 1999-present a historical and social portrait for the millennium, a tale of our times in all its grandeur and all its horror.<br></p><p>Perhaps it's fitting that the 1999 winner of the Nobel Prize for literature, Gï¿½nter Grass, should be the one to see the old millennium out in style. His <i>My Century</i> is comprised of 100 short chapters, one for each year of the 20th century, each told by a different narrator. And of course, since Grass is German, the century he refers to is German as well--a fact that could prove a little daunting to readers not familiar with the intricacies of that country's history. "1900," for example, throws us smack in the middle of the Chinese Boxer Rebellion from a German soldier's point of view. "1903" jumps us into the head of a young student who, clad in a new boater, admires the first Zeppelin, buys a copy of Thomas Mann's latest book, <i>Buddenbrooks</i>, and attends the launching of the world's largest ship, <i>Imperator</i>, among other historical events. "1904" is concerned with a miners' strike and "1906" is all about German-Moroccan foreign relations. <p> Yet as year succumbs to year and one narrative voice piles on top of the next, <i>My Century</i> becomes more than the sum of its parts. And Grass always manages to surprise. The chapters "1914" through "1918," for example, rather than being narrated by the usual suspects--young soldiers in the trenches, worried mothers at home, embittered war widows or shell-shocked veterans--are relayed by a '60s-era young woman who brings two great German chroniclers of the war together. As the now-elderly Erich Maria Remarque (<i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i>) and Ernst Jï¿½nger (<i>On the Marble Cliffs</i>) meet and spar over the course of several meals, their reminiscences of the Great War present two radically different views. Jï¿½nger, for example, says: "I can state without compunction: As the years went by, the flame of the prolonged battle produced an increasingly pure and valiant warrior caste..." Remarque's response is to laugh in Jï¿½nger's face: </p><blockquote> Come on, Jï¿½nger! You sound like a country squire. Cannon fodder quaking in oversized boots--that's what they were. Animals. All right, maybe they were beyond fear, but death never left their minds. So what could they do? Play cards, curse, fantasize about spread-eagled women, and wage war--murder on command, that is. Which took some expertise. They discussed the advantages of the shovel over the bayonet: the shovel not only let you thrust below the chin; it gave you a good solid blow, on the diagonal, say, between neck and shoulder, which then cut right down to the chest, while the bayonet tended to get caught between the ribs and you had to go all the way up to the stomach to pull it loose. </blockquote> It may be Remarque and Jï¿½nger talking, but the prose is pure Grass. The years leading up to and including World War II are narrated by a variety of voices: a communist in a forced-labor camp in 1936; a schoolboy "playing" Spanish Civil War with his classmates in 1937. The events of Kristallnacht, November 9, 1938, become inextricably linked with the November 9, 1989, fall of the Berlin Wall, as a German schoolteacher gets in trouble with the Parent-Teacher Association for his "obsession with the past." Indeed, it is the way Grass mixes past and present, the voices of the famous and the ordinary, that lends such power to <i>My Century</i>; and by the time he brings the reader up to the last weird and wonderful chapter, his century has become ours as well. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>Gï¿½NTER GRASS (1927&#x2013;2015), Germany's most celebrated contemporary writer, attained worldwide renown with the publication of his novel <i>The Tin Drum</i> in 1959.

He was also the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, The BFG and many more brilliant stories. He remains THE WORLD&#39;S NUMBER ONE STORYTELLER. Quentin Blake has illustrated more than three hundred books and was Roald Dahl&#39;s favourite illustrator. In 1980 he won the prestigious Kate Greenaway Medal. In 1999 he became the first ever Children&#39;s Laureate and in 2013 he was knighted for services to illustration.Imagine what would happen if a nervous young parson were re-afflicted with a peculiar strain of his childhood dyslexia, so that he unknowingly pronounced backwards only the most significant word in every sentence. In the fiendish hands of Roald Dahl, the parishioners must not only suffer the offense of praising Dog, but when the unsuspecting vicar attempts to compliment a group of little old ladies on the fact that each of them knits , his actual words incite chaos. Written for the benefit of the Dyslexia Institute in London, this slight book employs a host of jocular (though sometimes vulgar) malaprops to accentuate the beleaguered parson's condition. Blake's daffy illustrations have long captured the outrageous humor of Dahl's text, and this collaboration proves no exception. Of special interest is the illustrator's touching tribute at the end of the book, both to the late author's talent and to his "passionate belief in the importance of reading," which inspired this, his last book.

Joan Crawford, Katharine Hepburn, Louise Brooks, Joan Blondell, Barbara Stanwyck and many other unforgettables speak their minds on their work and their relations with each other.

Howard to tell the stories of Conan the Barbarian. Now his three most breathtaking chronicles are available for the first time in one volume, to the sure delight of Jordan and Conan fans everywhere. In Conan the Magnificent, our hero is stalked amid the savage crags of the Kezankian Mountains, caught between rival armies as the sultry huntress Jondra closes in. In Conan the Triumphant, he enters the service of the sumptuous Lady Synelle, unaware that she is the secret high priestess of the demon-god AlKirr. In the third chronicle, Conan faces his most terrifying adversary yetthe Sinavi, demon guardians of the ancient tomb of the Vendhyan kings. He must first seek out an antidote to the unknown poison coursing through his veins, then resist the charms of the voluptuous noblewoman Vyndra, if he is to be Conan the Victorious.<br><br></p><p>Long before Robert Jordan built his wildly successful Wheel of Time series (debuting with 1990's <i>Eye of the World</i>), the now-canonized writer cut his fantasy teeth borrowing time with Robert E. Howard's dark pulp-fiction hero, Conan of Cimmeria. Of the six novels Jordan contributed to the Conan series (well, seven, if you count the alt-history <i>Conan the Destroyer</i>), three have been assembled here for rerelease: 1983's <i>Conan the Triumphant</i> and 1984's <i>Conan the Magnificent</i> and <i>Conan the Victorious</i>. (The other three appear in Jordan's first collection, <i>The Conan Chronicles</i>.)<p> Anyone who writes Conan stories immediately draws the scrutiny of true believers--those of us who carted around tattered Carter and de Camp paperbacks in our book bags for years, drooling over the lusty Boris Vallejo covers (laughably tame compared to the <i>Weird Tales</i> covers from the '20s and '30s, where Conan first appeared). But Jordan gets it right, some argue better than anyone but REH himself, soundly grasping the first rule of Conan writing: the stories aren't <i>about</i> Conan; Conan <i>is</i> the story. A problematic hero, an almost elemental force, Conan exists beyond good and evil--the predictable wench-hoisting and head-cleaving of a good Conan tale are just a backdrop for the blue-eyed barbarian, which plays perfectly to Jordan's superlative descriptive skills.</p><p> This second Jordan collection is classic Conan: <i>The Magnificent</i> pits the Cimmerian against belligerent hill people, a golden-eyed fire beast, and bow-toting noble babe Jondra; in <i>The Triumphant</i>, Conan kicks butt on the evil god Al'Kiir and his sinister (and, of course, hot) servant Lady Synelle; <i>The Victorious</i>has Conan wounded by a poisoned assassin's blade--and his search for an antidote leads him to Vendhya and a subterranean crypt guarded by the eight-armed beast Masrok and a host of demons.

His rearing on the family estate in the Rhineland had instilled in him a strong Catholic faith, a reverence for the fatherland, and a love of horsemanship and the hunt. And so, like his brother Georg, he accepted a commission when the call came to restore the pride Germany had lost in the humiliating peace of Versailles.<br><br>Soon, however, beyond the regimented and honor-bound world of the cavalry, von Boeselager would discover what shocking brutality the SS was perpetrating at the behest of the Third Reich&#x2019;s highest authorities. When, in the summer of 1942, he heard that five Roma had been killed in cold blood, von Boeselager&#x2019;s patriotism quickly turned to disgust. Under his commanding officer, Field Marshal von Kluge, Philipp and his brother joined a group of conspirators in a plot to kill Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler.<br><br>It was planned that Philipp would shoot both the Fï¿½hrer and Himmler in the officers&#x2019; casino during a camp inspection visit, but when that attempt had to be aborted at the last moment, the plotters resolved to use a bomb to assassinate Hitler alone. Once von Boeselager had delivered the explosives to Claus von Stauffenberg, a leader of the plot, he and Georg led an unauthorized retreat of cavalry units from the eastern front, a surreal night maneuver indelibly described here. The mission: to take control of Berlin and effect the coup d&#x2019;etat.<br><br>When the bomb failed to kill Hitler, the SS launched a terrifying purge of senior army officers. The von Boeselager brothers barely managed to return with their units to the eastern front in time to escape detection. One by one their fellow plotters were found out, tortured, and executed, but steadfast in their cause, they never gave up the von Boeselagers&#x2019; names. Georg would eventually fall in battle on the Russian front, but Philipp survived the war.<br><br>In this elegant but unflinching testimony, Philipp von Boeselager, until his death in 2008 the last surviving member of the plot code-named Valkyrie, gives voice to the spirit of the small but determined band of men whose sense of justice and honor could not be dissolved by the diabolical glamour of the Third Reich. Here is an invaluable new perspective on one of the most fascinating near misses of twentieth-century history.</p><p>Philipp Freiherr von Boeselager was born in Bonn, Germany, in 1917, the fifth of nine children. He was raised with a liberal education, strong moral and religious values, and a love of hunting. In 1938, he enlisted and was placed in the cavalry regiment. He rose to the rank of commanding lieutenant, only to join the German resistance in 1941. His participation in Valkyrie went undetected, and he lived to be the last surviving member of the plot. In 2003, France awarded von Boeselager the Legion of Honor. He died on May 1, 2008.<br><br>Florence Fehrenbach is the granddaughter of Karl von Wendt, a coconspirator and close friend of Philipp von Boeselager. She and her husband, Jï¿½rï¿½me Fehrenbach, convinced Boeselager, at the age of eighty-nine, to recount his experience.A Taste for Freedom My brother Georg was born in August 1915, I in September 1917. We were the fourth and fifth in a family of nine children. My family had settled in Heimerzheim, in the Rhineland, in 1910, leaving our old home in Bonn, which in the eighteenth century had been one of the residences of Prince-Archbishop Clemens August of Bavaria. With its&nbsp; network of canals and moats, its great central building&#x2014;white, gabled, and flanked by corner towers&#x2014;it stood on an island reached by a succession of bridges, like a summer palace in ancient China. Its immense grounds were left in a half-wild state where deer peacefully grazed and the familiar mixture of mystery and nature on the doorstep made Heimerzheim seem to us like a fairy-tale castle. Nothing was easier there than to retreat into a secret world. Imagination and children&#x2019;s games could hardly have found a more propitious place to develop. We had a liberal upbringing at Heimerzheim, something that always surprised the guests who passed through&#x2014;and they were many, since our mother be-lieved that those who had the good fortune to live in a great residence should keep an open house. But for all that, our upbringing was not permissive. Life was very clearly structured, framed by a few strictly defined moral principles: for example, it was forbidden to torture animals. Within this framework, we enjoyed a great deal of latitude. My father, Albert von Boeselager, was a cultured man of letters. His mother&#x2019;s side of the family hailed from Brussels, and he considered the European nobility a unitary body. He hunted all over the Continent and spoke four or five languages. Because of this, he attached particular importance to learning how to make proper use of freedom&#x2014;and the capacity for Christian discernment that was for him its corollary&#x2014;and also of hunting. Georg received his first rifle as a Christmas present in 1928, when he was only thirteen years old. At fifteen, my brother&#x2019;s list of kills already included some 150 head of game. His passion was such that he managed to sneak a disassembled rifle into our boarding school&#x2014;with my complicity, I must admit. When Father Strasser made the rounds of the bedrooms to check the students&#x2019; bags, we were forced once again to engage in a ruse. Each of us slipped part of the rifle into his shorts&#x2014;Georg the barrel and I the stock&#x2014;while the inspection took place. The maneuver was acrobatic, be-cause it was strictly forbidden to put our hands in our pockets, but we somehow had to prevent the parts of the rifle from slipping out. It was hunting that truly shaped our behavior in nature, and profoundly influenced our way of life. Georg, in particular, learned to find his way in the forest even before the sun came up; to creep up to within a few meters of a woodcock without scaring the bird away; to slip through the bushes without making the leaves rustle so as not to frighten the deer; to disappear into the vegetation, perfectly camouflaged; to wait patiently, silent and inactive; and to act at the right fraction of a second. In a word, hunting, practiced in a group or in the course of long solitary hikes, with that passion for animals that marks true nature lovers, made Georg a real Indian. He remained one. He was later to find this training ex-tremely valuable. Hunting was not only a way of hardening the body. It prepared us, without our being aware of it, for the laws of life, for the struggles of existence: saving one&#x2019;s strength, fleeing from an adversary, recovering, knowing how to use cunning, adapting to the enemy, assessing risk. We learned how to keep our sangfroid in the tumult of dogs excited by the battle, how to strike the throat of a stag or a boar in the coup de grï¿½ce and look without revulsion at the dark red fluid bubbling out of mortal wounds. We did not shiver upon seeing the brown trickle running down the pale pelt of a young deer, or the bloody foam staining the chops of an animal exhausted by the chase. We withstood the glassy stare of the dead animal and, finally, collected these bloody, damp trophies, the spolia opima of modern times. Hunting also accustomed us to the laws of violent death, internalized the notion of an offering. Yes, hunting was a preparation for the supreme sacrifice&#x2014;the sacrifice of life. The education we received at Godesberg did not differ from what we were taught at Heimerzheim, which I would call relaxed Catholicism. My family was profoundly Catholic, with a centuries-old history linked to that of the German Catholic princes. In the seventeenth century, our ancestors, the Heyden-Belderbusches, from whom we had inherited the Heimerzheim castle, had been ministers of the powerful archbishop of Cologne. During the same period, the Satzenhovens, from whom we had inherited the Kreuzberg estate, had served the prince electors of Mainz. As children, Georg and I were very close. Only two years apart, we were like Castor and Pollux&#x2014;natural playmates, and accomplices in the same practical jokes. But this intimacy, which made us almost a separate unit among our siblings, did not prevent us from developing different qualities; nor did it diminish the natural ascendancy of the elder child over the younger. As a duo, we complemented each other. Georg was physically more robust, more athletic, more intuitive, and instinctively perceptive regarding people, situations, and things. I, on the other hand, was more reflective and analytical. Two anecdotes from our early childhood clearly show our difference in character. At Heimerzheim, the grounds were full of wild deer. The animals sometimes came quite close to the house. One day, our older brothers Antonius and Hermann, who were then not quite ten, were amusing themselves by throwing pebbles at one of the deer, trying to provoke it. Sitting behind a stone bench, Georg was watching carefully. The roebuck, suddenly responding to the little devils&#x2019; challenge, was about to attack. Georg reacted with lightning speed; all of five years old, he seized the rifle that Antonius had left leaning against the bench and shot at the animal. <i>Ka-boom!</i> Bowled over by the rifle&#x2019;s recoil, Georg fell backward. Fortunately, he was not injured. But the explosion had frightened away the roebuck. As for me, when I was four years old I distinguished myself at a family dinner. Our cousin zu Stolberg-Stolberg had been seriously wounded in the head during the Great War. The surgeons had installed a silver plate on his skull to close the hole left by enemy fire, and he lived until the 1960s. I had heard about this extraordinary operation and wanted to see the result for myself. Climbing silently onto a chair, I leaned over my cousin&#x2019;s head and began to examine, discreetly and carefully, the bald area where the precious metal shone. They say that I then cried, disappointed, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not silver! There&#x2019;s no hallmark!&#x201d; As a reward for this impertinent observation, I received a couple of slaps. To tell the truth, our father never took much interest in his children&#x2019;s scholastic progress. After several years of taking lessons at home, however, the boys had to be subjected to modern education. &#x201c;School,&#x201d; our father said, sighing, &#x201c;is an obligation these days. It&#x2019;s very boring, but you&#x2019;ve got to do it!&#x201d; So we were enrolled in the Aloï¿½sius Jesuit secondary school in Godesberg, on the outskirts of Bonn. As it turned out, entering boarding school was not very traumatic. Heimerzheim was then less than an hour&#x2019;s drive from the school. The Jesuit tuition at Aloï¿½sius did not seek to train priests, but to reconcile the sacred and the profane in human beings, and to keep alive the flame of faith amid the chaos of the world. The practice of religion was not supposed to be an end in itself; it was intended to slip naturally into the schedules, the lives, and, as it were, the skins of the young boys. The five or six years we spent in Godesberg helped root in us a solid, authentic, uncomplicated, moderate faith. Ultimately, we acquired more a way of behaving than a body of knowledge, although nothing was omitted from the regular curriculum. In any case, we learned the most important thing that can be taught how to learn. The headmaster of the boarding school was a patriot. As he saw it, the Christian values, humanism, sense of honor, respect for others, and tradition of intellectual rigor and critical vigilance that had long characterized Jesuit pedagogy were not incompatible with patriotism. Interestingly, none of my classmates later became a Nazi supporter. This fact, which was rather exceptional in my generation, deserves to be noted. The Time of Choices 1933?36 In 1933, when the Nazis came to power, Georg was not yet seventeen years old; I was only fifteen. This event, although it later turned out to be crucial for us and our families, left us rather indifferent at the time. Our parents, though they certainly did not adhere to the ideology of the Nazi Party, were not sorry to see the end of the Weimar Republic. We knew what it was to feel humiliated after a defeat. Because we lived on the left bank of the Rhine, which was under Allied occupation between 1919 and 1926, we saw Canadian, British, and then French troops&#x2014;chiefly drawn from the colonies&#x2014;march past. These six years of peacetime occupation were long and burdensome. For Germans, the situation was incomprehensible: enemy troops had not entered the country on the western frontier, there had been no invasion during the war, and it was the Treaty of Versailles, a treaty considered unjust and designed to ruin the country, that had brought about foreign occupation. An occupation, even a tranquil one, is hardly likely to strengthen friendship among peoples. But the occupation of the Ruhr from 1923 to 1926 was accompanied by violence and turmoil, and resulted in 121 summary executions and tens of thousands of expulsions. It also led to a general strike, instigated by Chancellor Cuno, and the economic collapse of the industrial heart of Germany, which caused terrifying inflation. All that, I think, accentuated the Rhinelanders&#x2019; already very strong prejudice against the French, who had been seen for&nbsp; centuries as troublesome neighbors. The humiliations inflicted by the occupying forces did not escape my notice when I was a child. I remember that my parents were forbidden to attend my grandmother&#x2019;s funeral, on the pretext that my father was a reserve officer. I also recall how we congratulated Father Seelen, who had dared to sing the German national anthem, which was strictly prohibited on the left bank, in full view of the French troops. Fortunately Father Seelen was a Dutch citizen, and the French could not arrest him. That is how, as young men, we practiced as much resistance as possible. My father believed in European unity before it became fashionable; he was not at all inclined to vindictiveness. But as a former officer in the Great War, he was a patriot, and he wanted to see Germany regain all its rights as a great nation. He communicated this desire to us without imposing it on us. And our elder brother Antonius quite naturally joined the paramilitary organization Stahlhelm. I can understand if a foreign reader mistrusts German patriots&#x2019; political position in that period, and is tempted to see in it an inadmissible compromise with the goals pursued by Adolf Hitler. However, we German patriots were nonetheless able to tell the difference. We had no more cause to be ashamed of wanting to restore Germany than had the French, who, in 1914, wanted to restore Alsace and Lorraine to France. I must describe something that happened to me at that time that taught me a little about the methods of Hitler&#x2019;s men. In 1934 the chancellor of the Reich came to Bonn. Curious, I climbed over my boarding school&#x2019;s wall, accompanied by a classmate. We approached the Dreesen Hotel, where the chancellor was supposed to be staying, and found a hiding place where we might at least catch a glimpse of him on the steps. We were found out. Two SS men picked us up and, without further investigation, simply locked us in a garage. We were terrified that the headmaster of the school, informed of our escape, might punish us. Our internment, without food and without sleep, lasted until the early hours of the morning, but once the chancellor had departed, we were set free. Miraculously, our desertion had not been noticed at school. During that day and the following night we had plenty to think about. The somewhat suspicious nature of the Nazi movement was soon revealed in another way. The headmaster of the school in Bad Godesberg, Father Rodewyck, a Jesuit and a former military officer in the Great War, was not indifferent to the revival of patriotism. But he was able to channel the ardor of the boys entrusted to him by providing a Christian framework within his school and avoiding any pollution by Nazi ideology. Thus in 1933 George founded a Catholic patriotic movement in the school whose scouting spirit was indicated by its attachment to moral and religious values. It was called the Jungstahlhelm. Along similar lines, the Jesuit school founded a movement on the model of Hitler&#x2019;s Deutsche Jungvolk or Pimpfen, whose activities (camping, hik- ing, and the like) then seemed quite innocent. Father Rodewyck had seen the risk that hearts and souls might be won by the Nazi Party&#x2019;s youth organizations, and he preferred to infiltrate the movement using boys like us. Our principal thought he had done what was necessary to keep control of the organization. But it gradually escaped his grasp and that of the school. It was at this time that another important episode occurred. I belonged to a club devoted to Our Lady: the Congregation of Mary. One fine day in the summer of 1937, the head of my group of Pimpfen, a nice fellow, came to tell me that belonging to the valiant Pimpfen was incompatible with religion, and so I had to choose between the two. I was intelligent; he was sure that he would succeed in persuading me to give up my membership in the Congregation of Mary without hesitation. But I flatly refused. I found it intolerable to be forced to make such a choice, and did not hesitate. I have to admit that I did not reveal the precise motive for my refusal. I told him only that preparing for my final school examination prevented me from continuing to participate in Pimpfen activities. The pretext seemed valid, and it was accepted. Georg took his final exam in the summer of 1934. He had already made a decision regarding his future: he wanted to be a military officer. My brother had a taste for action and initiative. He excelled in all athletic disciplines, had inexhaustible energy, and showed great endurance. He liked the outdoor life. And in the end, he was interested in human psychology. Objectively, everything pointed him toward this profession. At that time people believed, not without a certain naï¿½vetï¿½, that entering the army was a way of serving one&#x2019;s country without serving the government. It seemed to us that the army was the only institution that had remained faithful to its principles and was capable, through its vitality and culture, of preserving its identity and, especially, its autonomy. In 1934, for a young man like Georg, a military career still seemed to make it possible to reconcile a taste for action with independence.</p><h2>The Healing (Bluestreak)</h2><p>Gayl Jones's special gift is to shape experience and make it seem unshaped. -John Alfred Avant, <i>The New Republic</i><br><br>Gayl Jones's first novel, <i>Corregidora</i>, won her recognition as a writer whose work was gripping, subtle, and sure. It was praised, along with her second novel, <i>Eva's Man</i>, by writers and critics from all over the nation: John Updike, Maya Angelou, John Edgar Wideman, and James Baldwin, to name a few. The publication of <i>The Healing</i>, her first novel in over twenty years, is a literary event.<br><br>Harlan Jane Eagleton is a faith healer, traveling by bus to small towns, converting skeptics, restoring minds and bodies. But before that she was a minor rock star's manager, and before that a beautician. She's had a fling with her rock star's ex-husband and an Afro-German horse dealer; along the way she's somehow lost her own husband, a medical anthropologist now traveling with a medicine woman in Africa. Harlan tells her story from the end backwards, drawing us constantly deeper into her world and the mystery at the heart of her tale-the story of her first healing.<br><br><i>The Healing</i> is a lyrical and at times humorous exploration of the struggle to let go of pain, anger, and even love. Slipping seamlessly back through Harlan's memories in a language rich with the textured cadences of the black Southerner, Gayl Jones weaves her story to its dramatic-and unexpected-beginning.</p><p>Beautician, anthropologist's wife, rock-star manager, racetrack gambler, and now itinerant faith healer: the heroine of Gayl Jones long-awaited new novel has traveled a long and difficult road from her grandmother's Louisville beauty shop to the bus stops and "tank towns" of the rural South. As she spools back through her accumulated memories, Harlan Jane Eagleton weaves a complex stream-of-consciousness tale that at second glance turns out not to be chaotic at all. Jones has an unerring ear for dialogue and the rhythms of everyday speech, and Eagleton makes poetry out of even the detritus of pop culture--although her narrative is also rich in allusions from Chaucer to Gayl Jones herself. From Eagleton's grandmother, who believes she was born as a turtle, to the paranoid German-African businessman who becomes Eagleton's lover, the novel is filled with memorable characters and multilayered relationships. <i>The Healing</i> is the first book in more than 20 years from Jones, the reclusive author of two seminal narratives of violence, slavery, abuse, and black rage, <i>Corregidora</i> and <i>Eva's Man</i>. Like these two novels, <i>The Healing</i> has its fair share of violence and tragedy, but--as the title might suggest--here it's tempered with a surprising portion of humor, forgiveness, even faith.Gayl Jones was born in Kentucky in 1949.

It wasn&#x2019;t until 1951, while searching for books to read to his young son, Fritz, that he began writing children&#x2019;s stories. His classic Tales of Magic series started with the best-selling <i>Half Magic,</i> published in 1954. In each of his books he carefully acknowledges his indebtedness to E. Nesbit, whom he considered the best children&#x2019;s writer of all time&#x2014;&#x201c;so that any child who likes my books and doesn&#x2019;t know hers may be led back to the master of us all.&#x201d;It's hard for any book with magic in it not to pale next to the Harry Potter phenomenon. However, Seven- Day Magic can just about stoop to the challenge. Five children discover a mysterious red book at the library and eventually they discover that it's writing the story of their own wishful adventures--a story they make up as they go, and then witness coming to life in the red book's pages. Along their way, the children meet a dragon, a wizard, and the baby and little girl from Half Magic, another Eager book. Another adventure starts when the children are transported back in time with grandmother and nearly perish in a blizzard. Disaster almost strikes again when the friends wish themselves at a television rehearsal and it nearly costs one of their fathers his job on a show. The children return the book to the library and wonder who will find it next. Although written nearly forty years ago, Seven-Day Magic has a timeless feel, even if the adventures seem a bit tame by modern standards. 1999 (orig. ) (<i>Children's Literature</i>)</p><h2>China and Its People in Early Photographs: An Unabridged Reprint of the Classic 1873/4 Work</h2><p>From Foreword - Unabridged reprint of 1873-1874 book.

Americans in different regions are as proud of and as proprietary concerning their native foodstuffs as they are their tourist attractions. So when the folks at <i>Better Homes and Gardens</i> attribute, say, chicken-fried steak with gravy to Iowa or Jewish fruit kugel to Delaware, arguments about recipe ownership and origin just might escalate. A photographic panorama of the seven regions of the U.S. provides the backdrop for some solid research and more than 300 recipes adapted for contemporary kitchens.

Laura Auricchio gives us a rich portrait of the man, fully revealed, a man driven by dreams of glory and felled by tragic, human weaknesses. <br><br>In <i>The Marquis,</i> we come to understand the personal struggles, social quandaries, and idealistic visions that inspired an orphaned young man to cross an ocean and fight a war that was none of his concern; we see a guileless provincial whose unexpected inheritance allowed him to marry into the highest echelons of the French aristocracy, and become a self-consciously awkward presence at the palace of Versailles. Here is the young Lafayette, removed from the French army as a result of sweeping reforms, trapped in a gilded cage until American emissaries reached Paris seeking support for their revolution. In the American cause, Lafayette, whose only vision had been of martial glory, saw a way to reach his dreams, and seized it with gusto. Americans welcomed him with open arms, and he returned their affection fully. His American ï¿½clat was so brilliant and his enthusiasm so great that he quickly became the symbol of the Franco-American alliance that ultimately defeated Great Britain. <br><br>We see how Lafayette&#x2019;s reputation rose to great heights during the American Revolution but collapsed during the French; that when the Bastille fell on July 14, 1789, &nbsp;Parisians hailed Lafayette as the French Washington and appointed him commander of their National Guard, hoping that he would be able to restore order to a city wracked by starvation and violence. As revolutionaries hurtled in radical directions and staunch monarchists dug in their heels, Lafayette lost control, remaining steadfast in his belief that the French monarchy needed to be reformed but not abolished, and doing everything in his power to prevent an American-style republic from taking root in his native land.

In France, it is often seen as just one of his many misbegotten undertakings. Yet no one has managed to offer a satisfactory answer to the crucial question of why: Why did Americans shower Lafayette with so much acclaim in his own time that he remains a hero today, being named an honorary U.S. citizen in 2002&#x2014;becoming only the seventh person ever granted this distinction? And why, in contrast, does his memory continue to be denigrated in his own land?<br><br>Auricchio, drawing on substantial new research conducted in libraries, archives, museums, and private homes in France and the United States, gives us history on a grand scale as she answers these crucial questions, revealing the man and his complex life, and challenging and exploring the complicated myths that have surrounded his name for more than two centuries.</p><p>Laura Auricchio is a specialist in eighteenth-century French history and art who received her undergraduate degree from Harvard and her PhD from Columbia University.

Coming to a sudden stop at an unmarked door, he rifled through a ring of oversized keys, turned the latch, and switched on a light to reveal a small, sparsely furnished room coated with a fine film of dust. This was clearly not one of the chï¿½teau&#x2019;s most popular locations, but it contained the treasure I had come to see: a white marble bust of Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette (1757&#x2013;1834). Carved in 1790 by the renowned sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon, the bust portrays Lafayette as an officer and a gentleman: his uniform signals his cherished role as commander of the French National Guard, his powdered coiffure is expertly arranged, and his firm jaw and oblique gaze suggest absorption in matters of grave importance.<br> &nbsp;<br> As I admired this noble countenance of stone, a wry smile crept across the curator&#x2019;s face. Suddenly, the silence was broken. &#x201c;Why,&#x201d; asked the curator, &#x201c;should we have a bust of Lafayette?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The question surprised me. After all, I said, Lafayette is the French hero of the American Revolution&#x2014;the Hero of Two Worlds, the Apostle of Liberty. I had learned about him in school and knew that he was worthy of admiration. Lafayette was just nineteen years old and one of the richest men in France when he relinquished the comforts of his station to serve the cause of freedom half a world away. &#x201c;The Marquis,&#x201d; as Americans called him, led our troops into battle, froze with them at Valley Forge, and clothed and fed them at his own expense. News of Lafayette&#x2019;s daring adventures thrilled all of France, and that excitement encouraged the French king, Louis XVI&#x2014;an absolute monarch&#x2014;to support a revolution. Knowing that Lafayette helped us win independence, generations of Americans have expressed our nation&#x2019;s gratitude by naming countless towns, counties, streets, parks, and schools in his honor. Lafayette is so esteemed in the United States that his statue stands across from the White House, in Washington, D.C.&#x2019;s Lafayette Square. A bust is just one more token of well-deserved appreciation.<br> &nbsp;<br> After listening politely, the curator shook his head and pointed to a plaque installed a few feet away. It was a memorial commemorating the deaths of thousands of French soldiers and sailors who, sent across the Atlantic by their king, had lost their lives fighting for American freedom. He repeated the question, a bit louder this time: &#x201c;Why should we have a bust of Lafayette?&#x201d; These men were killed in the American Revolution, he said, but they have no statues. Louis XVI bankrupted France for the cause of American liberty and received his thanks from the guillotine. Besides, it was not Lafayette but the Comte de Rochambeau who led the French forces in America. How and why did we come to revere&#x2014;of all the sons of France who came to America&#x2019;s aid&#x2014;the Marquis de Lafayette?<br> &nbsp;<br> I began to see his point. During the winter of 1776, Lafayette&#x2019;s inter- est in the American cause was not unique. In fact, it could hardly be called unusual. The fashionable salons of Paris were abuzz that season with talk of &#x201c;les insurgents,&#x201d; as the envoys sent by Congress were fondly known, and a card game called &#x201c;Le Boston&#x201d; was sweeping through high society. The best French homes feted George Washington in absentia, and Benjamin Franklin delighted all of Paris, where he cut a conspicuous figure in a marten-fur cap&#x2014;an accessory that toyed with French perceptions of rustic Americans.<br> &nbsp;<br> If pleasure-loving Parisians enjoyed the novelty of these New World republicans, many military men saw the Americans&#x2019; cause as an opportunity for revenge. The army had been nursing its wounds since 1763, when the French and Indian War (known in France as the Seven Years&#x2019; War) had ended with France ceding its Canadian colonies to Great Britain. By helping to wrest thirteen valuable colonies from British control, a humiliated French officers&#x2019; corps hoped to redeem itself. So pervasive was enthusiasm for the American fight that the economist and author Andrï¿½ Morellet&#x2014;an astute social observer who often accompanied Franklin on his rounds&#x2014;quipped in 1777 that &#x201c;there is more support for American independence in Paris than in the entire province of New York.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet there was something uncommon about Lafayette&#x2019;s commitment to America. His devotion was deeper than his countrymen&#x2019;s, his drive more intense. While other Frenchmen sailed for the New World seeking riches or retribution, Lafayette sought nothing short of a new life. Earnest, enthusiastic&#x2014;as optimistic as Voltaire&#x2019;s naï¿½f Candide&#x2014;Lafayette was out of place in the glittering Parisian world of wit and cynicism that the urbane Franklin so effortlessly mastered.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lafayette had married into one of the best-connected families of the French court, but he hailed from the Auvergne region of south-central France, and the uncontrived manners of that rural area marked him as a stranger in the refined circles of his in-laws. At Versailles, even Lafayette&#x2019;s rugged appearance counted against him. The young marquis was large for his time: five feet, nine inches tall and endowed with a broad frame that one contemporary described as &#x201c;decidedly inclined to embonpoint.&#x201d; In other words, he tended to be stout. As Lafayette grew older, his bold features would be called distinguished, but as a youth he was not widely perceived as handsome. He had a long, oval face with a prominent aquiline nose, gray-blue eyes that peered out from a pale complexion, and a shock of unfashionably red hair atop a high, sloping forehead. Friends and admirers saw Lafayette&#x2019;s open and frank expression as a window to his soul, but this transparent credulity placed him at a disadvantage in the dissimulating games of intrigue that passed for sociability at Versailles.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lafayette felt more comfortable in the saddle than perched on a gilded stool, and he remained uneasy in a society that cultivated an ideal of disaffected nonchalance; feigned detachment was foreign to his character. Reared on tales of his ancestors&#x2019; military exploits, Lafayette yearned to prove himself worthy of such a legacy. Enthusiasm may have been unfashionable, but Lafayette made no attempt to hide his zeal. The &#x201c;love of glory,&#x201d; Lafayette recalled in his memoirs, inspired him to excel at school, where he vied for academic prizes bestowed in public ceremonies. The urge to escape &#x201c;a life without glory,&#x201d; he explained to his wife in 1777, compelled him to sail for America. &#x201c;Glory,&#x201d; he assured George Washington in 1778, was his only ambition. To be clear, the glory Lafayette sought was quite divorced from notions of splendor. In 1762, a French dictionary defined &#x201c;glory&#x201d; as a &#x201c;reputation&#x201d; garnered through &#x201c;virtue, merit, great qualities, good actions and beautiful works&#x201d;; synonyms included &#x201c;honor, esteem, praise.&#x201d; Once earned, glory was its own reward. Many men of Lafayette&#x2019;s generation hoped for glory, but Lafayette was single-mindedly devoted to its pursuit.<br> &nbsp;<br> In America, Lafayette found glory and more. Here, for the first time since leaving the Auvergne, he was surrounded by people who saw his sincerity as a virtue, not a flaw. The public welcomed him immediately&#x2014; Lafayette was the only marquis in the American army, and his title all but guaranteed his renown. The same nation that rejected Old World traditions of hereditary privilege rejoiced to find a highborn nobleman on its side, as if his interest in the American cause proved its universal appeal. And if Lafayette&#x2019;s rank opened doors, his personality won hearts. As news of Lafayette&#x2019;s unaffected charm made its way through the colonies, even the most hardened anti-French feelings began to dis- solve. Then as now, Americans prided themselves on plain dealing, and those who met Lafayette were pleasantly surprised to discover that this exceptional Frenchman shared their sensibility.<br> &nbsp;<br> Surely Lafayette deserves to be remembered. Why, then, had the French curator seemed perplexed by the bust?<br> &nbsp;<br> Part of the answer is that Lafayette succeeded so completely in cultivating an American identity that, even in France, he remains a distinctly American hero. In 1781, after the British surrendered to allied forces at Yorktown, most of the French officers in America returned to France and to the pursuits they had left behind. But Lafayette, who had left his homeland as an outcast, had no career to reprise. Serving as America&#x2019;s foremost French advocate became his primary occupation, and the spirit of the new nation assumed a position at the very core of his being. Lafayette, who called Washington his adoptive father, turned his Left Bank town house into a home away from home for visiting Americans. The Adamses, the Jeffersons, and the ubiquitous Franklin were frequent guests at Monday suppers, where English was the language of choice and where Lafayette&#x2019;s children&#x2014;including his son, named George Washington, and a daughter known as Virginie&#x2014;sang songs in English. Mementos of the United States abounded: a gold- engraved copy of the Declaration of Independence hung on a wall of honor, plants from the New World decorated the terrace, and books on American history filled the shelves. For a time, a young man of Iroquois descent lived with Lafayette&#x2019;s family as &#x201c;a favourite Servant.&#x201d; As the explorer John Ledyard wrote of Lafayette in 1787, &#x201c;he has planted a tree in America, and sits under its shade at Versailles.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But the curator may not have been objecting to Lafayette&#x2019;s Americanization; more likely he was hinting at a darker chapter of Lafayette&#x2019;s story. Although Lafayette was an indefatigable champion of righteous causes, he did not always meet with success. During the French Revolution, he failed spectacularly. In America, we remember his triumphs; in France, few outside of his native Auvergne see him as a hero. So little does France love Lafayette that the monumental Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution, published by a leading team of French historians in 1988, states flatly that &#x201c;the man has drawn few eulogies.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> At the outset of the French Revolution, in 1789, Lafayette&#x2019;s moment of glory seemed to be at hand. On July 15, the morning after the storming of the Bastille prison, popular acclaim placed Lafayette at the helm of the newly established National Guard. The following month, Lafayette became the first person to submit a proposal for a &#x201c;Declaration of the Rights of Man&#x201d;&#x2014;a set of principles that would serve as the foundation of a new constitution&#x2014;to France&#x2019;s newly formed legislature. On July 14, 1790, Paris commemorated the first anniversary of the Bastille&#x2019;s fall with a grand public festival featuring Lafayette as its undisputed star. Newspapers and broadsides compared Lafayette to Washington, and prints depicted him as a vanquisher of despotism, wielding a sword of justice.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet Lafayette&#x2019;s French triumphs were troubled from the start. As commander of the National Guard, Lafayette was charged with the impossible task of keeping the peace in a city racked by violence. Time and again Lafayette looked on helplessly as brutal justice was meted out in the streets, and he grew to loathe the politicians who, in his view, incited the crowds to further their own interests. Although he had assisted at the birth of the United States, Lafayette rejected the notion that France could sustain an American-style republic. He believed that France&#x2019;s monarchical traditions were too ancient and revered to be cast aside, and he deemed the French people too uneducated and uninterested, perhaps even temperamentally unsuited, to shoulder the burden of self-governance. Lafayette never embraced radical politics, and he made enemies of those who did. As he saw it, a constitutional monarchy was the only form of government that could guarantee liberty in France, and he defended this view to the end. In the revolution&#x2019;s early days, many forward-thinking men and women shared the same hope. But as the nation grew increasingly polarized, most of his allies abandoned the dream, while Lafayette stood fast on a middle ground that was rapidly eroding.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lafayette was proud to call himself a moderate in an era of extremes. Explaining his philosophy later in life, he insisted that &#x201c;true moderation consists, not as many people seem to think, in always seeking the middle between any two points . . . but in trying to recognize the point of truth and holding to it.&#x201d; Rarely has a man held to moderate principles with such tenacity. By 1791, partisans on both the left and the right (these political terms emerged precisely during this period) came to see him as a traitor to their respective causes. Supporters of the monarchy denounced him as a rabble-rouser. Centrist rivals falsely accused him of carrying on an affair with the despised queen Marie Antoinette&#x2014; and commissioned a memorable series of pornographic pamphlets and prints to drive the point home. Republicans lambasted him for perceived attacks on freedom of the press. As circumstances grew ever more desperate, Lafayette made increasingly grievous mistakes. One by one, the crown, the people, and, finally, the army turned against him. Had he not fled the country in 1792, Lafayette would surely have been executed. Still he clung to his principles. By the end, they were very nearly all he had left.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lafayette was only thirty-four years old when he went into exile, and although he lived to be seventy-six and remained active in French politics until his final days, he never stopped thinking, writing, and talking about the historic events of his young adulthood. Those events defined his life, and for that reason, they form the core of this book. Writing in 1815 to the author Benjamin Constant&#x2014;a friend and political ally&#x2014;Lafayette took a moment to reflect on a remarkable lifetime that had been filled with bold dreams, tremendous achievements, and tragic failures. &#x201c;I have been reproached all my life,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;for giving in too much to my hopeful disposition; I will respond that it is the only way to do something out of the ordinary. One would, indeed, never try anything extraordinary if one despaired of success.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Why should we have a bust of Lafayette? Not because he was infallible or superhuman or endowed with gifts that the rest of us lack. We should have a bust of Lafayette precisely because he was all too human. He lived in treacherous times and made imperfect choices. He failed at more ventures than most of us will ever attempt and succeeded at efforts that stymied countless men, but he never abandoned the belief that he could change the world, and he never despaired of success. Of all his accomplishments, these might be the most extraordinary.</p><h2>The Good Earth</h2><p>Well researched</p><p></p><h2>Gardens of the Moon: A Tale of the Malazan Book of the Fallen</h2><p><b>Marking the 10th anniversary of its publication &#x2014; a special collectors' hardback edition of this defining work of epic fantasy.</b><br><br>Bled dry by interminable warfare, infighting and bloody confrontations with Anomander Rake, Son of Darkness, the Malazan Empire simmers with discontent.

An early revolutionary, he became increasingly disillusioned with Soviet society, and three of his plays - all of which were banned until after Stalin&#39;s death - reflect his changing assessments of the Revolution. They are collected here with his first, more personal work, Vladimir Mayakovsky: A Tragedy. This volume includes Mystery Bouffe, a mock medieval mystery play written in 1918 to celebrate the first anniversary of the Revolution; The Bathhouse, a sharp attack on Soviet bureaucracy subtitled &#34;a drama of circus and fireworks&#34;; and The Bedbug, in which a worker with bourgeois pretensions is frozen and resurrected fifty years later, when the world has been transformed into a material paradise. Mayakovsky&#39;s first play, Vladimir Mayakovsky: A Tragedy, reveals the poet&#39;s propensity for painful self-dramatization and his flair for grotesque imagery. Fresh, inventive, and shot through with zany humor, Mayakovsky&#39;s plays represent a radically new kind of theater.<p>Vladimir Vladimirovich Mayakovsky (1893 &#x2013; 1930) was a Russian and Soviet poet and playwright.

National ad/promo.</p><p>Second only to the <i>Titanic</i>'s 1912 collision with an iceberg in terms of famous sinkings of ocean liners, the <i>Lusitania</i>, also a British luxury ship, was torpedoed in May_ 1915 by a German submarine and in 18 minutes went under the waves off the coast of Ireland. Because 123 of the dead were American, the destruction of the <i>Lusitania</i> was a step in drawing the U.S. into World War I, already raging in Europe. In 1993 a team working with underwater explorer Robert Ballard, discoverer of the <i>Titanic</i>'s remains, used a small submarine to find the wreckage of the <i>Lusitania</i>. Ballard profiles the luxurious life of the <i>Lusitania</i> while in trans-Atlantic service and reconstructs its scandalous wartime "assassination" in this oversize book. And in addition to profuse illustrations of the liner during its life and creepy ones of its carcass lying on the ocean floor, Ballard and his coauthor address the controversy that has surrounded the <i>Lusitania</i>'s sinking from that day to this: Why did it explode so violently when the torpedo hit and then sink so quickly? Ballard's investigation indicates that an "extraordinary combination of circumstances" destined that the <i>Lusitania</i> would not survive its attack. <i>Brad Hooper</i></p><h2>Classical Music 101: A Complete Guide to Learning and Loving Classical Music</h2><p><strong>A Paperback Original.</strong><p><strong>The author who has taught tens of thousands of people to love opera now introduces readers to the rich and soul-stirring world of classical music.</strong></p><p>For anyone who is aching to discover classical music, this comprehensive and accessible book is the ideal teacher. Writing in the clear and highly entertaining prose that made <em>Opera 101</em> the standard text in its field, Fred Plotkin -- music expert, teacher, lecturer, and famous author -- presents classical music in a way that respects both the reader and the art form. In <em>Classical Music 101</em>: --The reader will discover how to become an expert listener, which is essential for learning to love classical music.<br>--A thousand years of music are explored, with emphasis on great works in all styles. Significant composers will be profiled in depth, including Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, Tchaikovsky, Dvorak, and many more.</p><p>--Important musicians, such as pianist Emanuel Ax, singer Marilyn Horne, and conductor James Levine, speak about their art in interviews.</p><p><em>Classical Music 101</em>, the newest addition to a highly successful series intended for readers who don't consider themselves dummies or idiots, will help the person drawn to the finer things in life (and readers who don't know how to approach them) discover the glories of music.</p></p><p><strong>Fred Plotkin</strong> is the author of the bestselling and acclaimed<em>Opera 101: A Complete Guide to Learning and Loving Opera</em>, which is the standard text in North American for discovering the glories of opera. He writes for the<em>New York Times</em>, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, <em>Opera News</em>, <em>Das Opernglas</em>, and <em>Gourmet</em>. He lectures on music for leading institutions, including Columbia University, the Juilliard School, and the Smithsonian. Plotkin is a popular guest on the intermission features of the Chevron Texaco-Metropolitan Opera broadcasts, and many shows on National Public Radio. An expert on Italy, he has written five definitive books on Italian food and wine.The latest of many introductory books on Western classical music, Plotkin's is a fine addition to the genre, though some may prefer Robert Sherman and Philip Seldon's more traditionally organized Complete Idiot's Guide to Classical Music or Michael Walsh's hilarious and opinionated Who's Afraid of Classical Music? While most such books are at least partially chronological, Plotkin's revolves almost entirely around the orchestra's instruments and the listening experience. He presents material as coursework, and his strictures about really listening (as opposed to mere "hearing") are well taken and certainly apply to all kinds of music. A valuable feature are the interviews with classical musicians interspersed throughout. One weakness is that opera is not significantly treated, perhaps because Plotkin covered that ground in an earlier book, Opera 101: A Guide to Learning and Loving Opera. The discography is organized by chapter rather than composer (which makes it a bit awkward to use as a stand-alone source), but it is superior to the one in the Idiot's Guide. Recommended for libraries desiring an up-to-date and informative general introduction to classical music. Bruce R. Schueneman, Texas A&amp;M Univ.

The fur of Joe Grey, Feline P.I., that is. After all, Molena Point has been his home since he was a kitten eating scraps from the garbage behind the local delicatessen, and he doesn't take well to marauding strangers. Joe even wonders whether the blonde who's moved into next to his human companion Clyde could be a part of the gang&#x2013;&#x2013;she's been acting pretty suspicious lately. But when the strangers start trapping and caging feral cats&#x2013;&#x2013;speaking cats like Joe and his girlfriend Dulcie&#x2013;&#x2013;it proves too much for the intrepid four&#x2013;footed detective. And when one of the gang is murdered, and a second mysterious death comes to light, he has no choice but to try to stop the crimes. Joe, Dulcie, and their tattercoat friend Kit, who used to be a stray herself, are deep into the investigation when they are able to release the three trapped cats. But as Kit leads them away to freedom, will she herself return to that wild life?</p></p><p><p>Shirley Rousseau Murphy is the author of twenty mysteries in the Joe Grey series, for which she has won the Cat Writers&#x2019; Association Muse Medallion nine years running, and has received ten national Cat Writers&#x2019; Association Awards for best novel of the year. She is also a noted children&#x2019;s book author, and has received five Council of Authors and Journalists Awards. She lives in Carmel, California, where she serves as full-time household help to two demanding feline ladies.</p>Joe Gray, feline P.I., is a descendant of Celtic cats who can speak in a human voice. Joe speaks mostly to his human companion, Clyde. When break-ins start in their California town, Joe and his feline friends are on the job to find the culprits. William Dufris crafts voices that fit this story by showing respect for and insight into the characters. If a cat really could speak, one imagines that he would speak in the sardonic, superior tone that Dufris uses for Joe. The humans are well done too; all are portrayed with nuances and subtleties that enhance the story. Fans of the series will delight in Dufris's layered performance.

His insistent exploration of &#x201c;nonintention&#x201d; and his fruitful merging of Western and Eastern traditions have made him a powerful force in the world of the avant-garde.</p><p>There have never been lectures like these: delivered at Harvard in 1988&#x2013;89 as the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures, they were more like performances, as the audience heard them. Cage calls them &#x201c;mesostics,&#x201d; a literary form generated by chance (in this case computerized I-Ching chance) operations. Using the computer as an oracle in conjunction with a large source text, he happens upon ideas, which produce more ideas. Chance, and not Cage, makes the choices and central decisions. Such a form is rooted, Cage tells us in his introduction, in the belief that &#x201c;all answers answer all questions.&#x201d;</p><p>Acting as a kind of counterpoint to the six texts here are transcripts (edited by Cage) of the provocative question-and-answer seminars that followed each presentation. Included with the book are two audiocassettes, one of Cage reading a mesostic (IV), allowing the listener to experience it as it was delivered, and one with a lively selection from the question-and-answer seminars that conveys the flavor of the event. The illustrations consist of fifteen different chance-determined prints from a single negative by Robert Mahon of the first autograph page of Cage&#x2019;s <i>Sixteen Dances</i> (1951).</p><p><i>I&#x2013;VI</i> is, in short, an experience of John Cage, where silences become words and words become silences, in arrangements that will disconcert and exercise our minds.</p></p><p>7 x 10&#34; trim. 15 illus. 1 Audio CD.

Most come only to sing or to listen, but one or two have non&#x2013;musical scores to settle. When brilliantly talented Liri Palmer sings &#x201c;Black, black, black is the color of my true&#x2013;love&#x2019;s heart!

Darren lives in Ireland, where he writes and collects art, comics, and film.<br>Shan&#x2019;s second book about the City takes place during roughly the same time period as the first (Procession of the Dead, 2010) but features many new characters, only tying together events from both books at the very end of the story. Al Jeery is a dedicated soldier for the Cardinal and happy to do his job until the day he takes a body to the morgue only to discover it is his girlfriend. Asked by the Cardinal to investigate, Al takes on the duty, persevering through a complex and often seemingly impossible investigation. Like Procession of the Dead, this story takes place entirely within Shan&#x2019;s fictional yet modern-day city, run by the Cardinal, but the plot is constructed in the fashion of a mainstream police procedural. With almost too many twists to believe, dozens of characters, and the complex mythology of the City itself, Hell&#x2019;s Horizon is not an easy read, yet it may appeal to those who enjoyed China Miï¿½ville&#x2019;s The City &amp; the City. --Jessica Moyer</p><h2>Roseanne Roseannadanna&#39;s &#34;Hey Get Back to Work Book&#34;</h2><p>OUR COPY HAS THE SAME COVER AS STOCK PHOTO SHOWN.

Porterfield </b>is a devotee of railroad history and a gourmet cook. He sorted through 7,500 authentic railroad recipes while preparing this book. He lives and teaches in State College, Pennsylvania.<br>Readers who sigh at the names "Super Chief" and "Zephyr," and who remember the meal Cary Grant ate on the train in North by Northwest , may find this book fulfilling their wildest dreams. In an attempt to "preserve a record of one of the ways we used to eat," rail fan and Penn State professor Porterfield presents a detailed history of train dining. Beginning as an alternative to railroad station eateries, train dining reached its peak in 1930, when 1732 railroad dining cars were registered with the Interstate Commerce Commission, and all but ended in 1971 with telegrams like the May 1 order to Union Pacific to shut its passenger lines and make way for Amtrak. Model railroaders and social historians will find the 150 photographs and illustrations invaluable: a photo spread with dimensions of the pantry of the New York Central's Twentieth Century Limited, a sample 1920s dinner menu from the Milwaukee Railroad's Pioneer Limited, descriptions of staff sleeping quarters. The second half of the book offers 250 recipes from 48 railroad lines, featuring early-20th-century fare like Lobster Newburg New York Central, Poinsettia Salad-Merchant's Limited and Baked Potato Pennsylvania.

Someone who is admired and whose ignominious destruction would cause dismay&#39; A beautiful Soviet spy. A brand-new Spektor cipher machine. Smersh has set an irresistible trap that threatens the entire Secret Service. In Fleming&#39;s fifth &#34;007&#34; novel Bond finds himself enmeshed in a deadly game of cross and double cross.</p><p>Ian Fleming was born in London on May 28, 1908. He was educated at Eton College and later spent a formative period studying languages in Europe. His first job was with Reuters News Agency where a Moscow posting gave him firsthand experience with what would become his literary <i>bete noire</i>&#x2014;the Soviet Union. During World War II he served as Assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence and played a key role in Allied espionage operations. <p>After the war he worked as foreign manager of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, a job that allowed him to spend two months each year in Jamaica. Here, in 1952, at his home &#x201c;Goldeneye,&#x201d; he wrote a book called <i>Casino Royale</i>&#x2014;and James Bond was born. The first print run sold out within a month. For the next twelve years Fleming produced a novel a year featuring Special Agent 007, the most famous spy of the century. His travels, interests, and wartime experience lent authority to everything he wrote. Raymond Chandler described him as &#x201c;the most forceful and driving writer of thrillers in England.&#x201d; Sales soared when President Kennedy named the fifth title, <i>From Russia With Love</i>, one of his favorite books. The Bond novels have sold more than one hundred million copies worldwide, boosted by the hugely successful film franchise that began in 1962 with the release of <i>Dr. No</i>. </p><p>He married Anne Rothermere in 1952. His story about a magical car, written in 1961 for their only son Caspar, went on to become the well- loved novel and film <i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</i>. </p><p>Fleming died of heart failure on August 12, 1964, at the age of fifty-six.</p><b>1. ROSELAND</b> <p>The naked man who lay splayed out on his face beside the swimming pool might have been dead.</p> <p>He might have been drowned and fished out of the pool and laid out on the grass to dry while the police or the next-of-kin were summoned. Even the little pile of objects in the grass beside his head might have been his personal effects, meticulously assembled in full view so that no one should think that something had been stolen by his rescuers.</p> <p>To judge by the glittering pile, this had been, or was, a rich man. It contained the typical membership badges of the rich man's club - a money clip, made of a Mexican fifty-dollar piece and holding a substantial wad of banknotes, a well-used gold Dunhill lighter, an oval gold cigarette case with the wavy ridges and discreet turquoise button that means Faberge, and the sort of novel a rich man pulls out of the bookcase to take into the garden - The Little Nugget - an old P.G. Wodehouse. There was also a bulky gold wristwatch on a well-used brown crocodile strap. It was a Girard-Perregaux model designed for people who like gadgets, and it had a sweep second-hand and two little windows in the face to tell the day of the month, and the month, and the phase of the moon. The story it now told was 2.30 on June 10th with the moon three-quarters full.</p> <p>A blue and green dragon-fly flashed out from among the rose bushes at the end of the garden and hovered in mid-air a few inches above the base of the man's spine. It had been attracted by the golden shimmer of the June sunshine on the ridge of fine blond hairs above the coccyx. A puff of breeze came off the sea. The tiny field of hairs bent gently. The dragonfly darted nervously sideways and hung above the man's left shoulder, looking down. The young grass below the man's open mouth stirred. A large drop of sweat rolled down the side of the fleshy nose and dropped glittering into the grass. That was enough. The dragonfly flashed away through the roses and over the jagged glass on top of the high garden wall. It might be good food, but it moved.</p> <p>The garden in which the man lay was about an acre of well-kept lawn surrounded on three sides by thickly banked rose bushes from which came the steady murmur of bees. Behind the drowsy noise of the bees the sea boomed softly at the bottom of the cliff at the end of the garden.</p> <p>There was no view of the sea from the garden - no view of anything except of the sky and the clouds above the twelve-foot wall. In fact you could only see out of the property from the two upstairs bedrooms of the villa that formed the fourth side of this very private enclosure. From them you could see a great expanse of blue water in front of you and, on either side, the upper windows of neighbouring villas and the tops of the trees in their gardens - Mediterranean-type evergreen oaks, stone pines, casuarinas and an occasional palm tree.</p> <p>The villa was modern - a squat elongated box without ornament. On the garden side the flat pink-washed facade was pierced by four iron-framed windows and by a central glass door leading on to a small square of pale green glazed tiles. The tiles merged into the lawn. The other side of the villa, standing back a few yards from a dusty road, was almost identical. But on this side the four windows were barred, and the central door was of oak.</p> <p>The villa had two medium-sized bedrooms on the upper floor and on the ground floor a sitting-room and a kitchen, part of which was walled off into a lavatory. There was no bathroom.</p> <p>The drowsy luxurious silence of early afternoon was broken by the sound of a car coming down the road. It stopped in front of the villa. There was the tinny clang of a car door being slammed and the car drove on. The doorbell rang twice. The naked man beside the swimming pool did not move, but, at the noise of the bell and of the departing car, his eyes had for an instant opened very wide. It was as if the eyelids had pricked up like an animal's ears. The man immediately remembered where he was and the day of the week and the time of the day. The noises were identified. The eyelids with their fringe of short sandy eyelashes drooped drowsily back over the very pale blue, opaque, inward-looking eyes. The small cruel lips opened in a wide jaw-breaking yawn which brought saliva into the mouth. The man spat the saliva into the grass and waited.</p> <p>A young woman carrying a small string bag and dressed in a white cotton shirt and a short, unalluring blue skirt came through the glass door and strode mannishly across the glazed tiles and the stretch of lawn towards the naked man. A few yards away from him, she dropped her string bag on the grass and sat down and took off her cheap and rather dusty shoes. Then she stood up and unbuttoned her shirt and took it off and put it, neatly folded, beside the string bag.</p> <p>The girl had nothing on under the shirt. Her skin was pleasantly sunburned and her shoulders and fine breasts shone with health. When she bent her arms to undo the side-buttons of her skirt, small tufts of fair hair showed in her armpits. The impression of a healthy animal peasant girl was heightened by the chunky hips in faded blue stockinet bathing trunks and the thick short thighs and legs that were revealed when she had stripped.</p> <p>The girl put the skirt neatly beside her shirt, opened the string bag, took out an old soda-water bottle containing some heavy colourless liquid and went over to the man and knelt on the grass beside him. She poured some of the liquid, a light olive oil, scented, as was everything in that part of the world, with roses, between his shoulder blades and, after flexing her fingers like a pianist, began massaging the sternomastoid and the trapezius muscles at the back of the man's neck.</p> <p>It was hard work. The man was immensely strong and the bulging muscles at the base of the neck hardly yielded to the girl's thumbs even when the downward weight of her shoulders was behind them. By the time she was finished with the man she would be soaked in perspiration and so utterly exhausted that she would fall into the swimming pool and then lie down in the shade and sleep until the car came for her. But that wasn't what she minded as her hands worked automatically on across the man's back. It was her instinctive horror for the finest body she had ever seen.</p> <p>None of this horror showed in the flat, impassive face of the masseuse, and the upward-slanting black eyes under the fringe of short coarse black hair were as empty as oil slicks, but inside her the animal whimpered and cringed and her pulse-rate, if it had occurred to her to take it, would have been high.</p> <p>Once again, as so often over the past two years, she wondered why she loathed this splendid body, and once again she vaguely tried to analyse her revulsion. Perhaps this time she would get rid of feelings which she felt guiltily certain were much more unprofessional than the sexual desire some of her patients awoke in her.</p> <p>To take the small things first: his hair. She looked down at the round, smallish head on the sinewy neck. It was covered with tight red-gold curls that should have reminded her pleasantly of the formalised hair in the pictures she had seen of classical statues. But the curls were somehow too tight, too thickly pressed against each other and against the skull. They set her teeth on edge like fingernails against pile carpet. And the golden curls came down so low into the back of the neck - almost (she thought in professional terms) to the fifth cervical vertebra. And there they stopped abruptly in a straight line of small stiff golden hairs.</p> <p>The girl paused to give her hands a rest and sat back on her haunches. The beautiful upper half of her body was already shining with sweat. She wiped the back of her forearm across her forehead and reached for the bottle of oil. She poured about a tablespoonful on to the small furry plateau at the base of the man's spine, flexed her fingers and bent forward again.</p> <p>This embryo tail of golden down above the cleft of the buttocks - in a lover it would have been gay, exciting, but on this man it was somehow bestial. No, reptilian. But snakes had no hair. Well, she couldn't help that. It seemed reptilian to her. She shifted her hands on down to the two mounds of the gluteal muscles. Now was the time when many of her patients, particularly the young ones on the football team, would start joking with her. Then, if she was not very careful, the suggestions would come. Sometimes she could silence these by digging sharply down towards the sciatic nerve. At other times, and particularly if she found the man attractive, there would be giggling arguments, a brief wrestling-match and a quick, delicious surrender.</p> <p>With this man it was different, almost uncannily different. From the very first he had been like a lump of inanimate meat. In two years he had never said a word to her. When she had done his back and it was time for him to turn over, neither his eyes nor his body had once shown the smallest interest in her. When she tapped his shoulder, he would just roll over and gaze at the sky through half-closed lids and occasionally let out one of the long shuddering yawns that were the only sign that he had human reactions at all.</p> <p>The girl shifted her position and slowly worked down the right leg towards the Achilles tendon. When she came to it, she looked back up the fine body. Was her revulsion only physical? Was it the reddish colour of the sunburn on the naturally milk-white skin, the sort of roast meat look? Was it the texture of the skin itself, the deep, widely spaced pores in the satiny surface? The thickly scattered orange freckles on the shoulders? Or was it the sexuality of the man? The indifference of these splendid, insolently bulging muscles? Or was it spiritual - an animal instinct telling her that inside this wonderful body there was an evil person?</p> <p>The masseuse got to her feet and stood, twisting her head slowly from side to side and flexing her shoulders. She stretched her arms out s...</p></p><h2>The Four Books: A Novel</h2><p>From master storyteller Yan Lianke, winner of the prestigious Franz Kafka Prize and a finalist for the Man Booker International Prize, <i>The Four Books</i> is a powerful, daring novel of the dog-eat-dog psychology inside a labor camp for intellectuals during Mao&#x2019;s Great Leap Forward. A renowned author in China, and among its most censored, Yan&#x2019;s mythical, sometimes surreal tale cuts to the bone in its portrayal of the struggle between authoritarian power and man&#x2019;s will to prevail against the darkest odds through camaraderie, love, and faith.<br><br>In the ninety-ninth district of a sprawling reeducation compound, freethinking artists and academics are detained to strengthen their loyalty to Communist ideologies. Here, the Musician and her lover, the Scholar along with the Author and the Theologian are forced to carry out grueling physical work and are encouraged to inform on each other for dissident behavior. The prize: winning the chance at freedom. They're overseen by preadolescent supervisor, the Child, who delights in reward systems and excessive punishments. When agricultural and industrial production quotas are raised to an unattainable level, the ninety-ninth district dissolves into lawlessness. And then, as inclement weather and famine set in, they are abandoned by the regime and left alone to survive.</p><p><b>Yan Lianke</b> is the author of numerous short story collections and novels, including<i>Serve the People!</i>, <i>Lenin's Kisses</i>, and <i>Dream of Ding Village</i>, which was shortlisted for the Man Asian Literary Prize and the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize and adapated into a film (<i>Til Death Do Us Part</i>).

It is unsparing in its picture of the ways in which totalitarian habits of thought seep deep into personal relations, and it is smart in its depiction of how intellectuals get co-opted by the system . . . [Yan&#x2019;s] fiction of ideas feels hard won and genuine, an expression of sorrow, bafflement, anger, and love." <b>Robert Anthony Siegel, The Rumpus</b><br><br>"Arch and playful. . . .

Stupendous and unforgettable . . . a devastating, brilliant slice of living history." <b>Kate Saunders, <i>The Times</i> (UK)</b><br><br>"No other writer in today's China has so consistently explored, dissected and mocked the past six and a half decades of Chinese communist rule. . . . An extraordinary novel, one that both commemorates the state&#x2019;s victims and defies China's state-sponsored amnesia." <b>Isabel Hilton, <i>Guardian</i></b><br><br>"A satirical tale about abuse of power and the vicious survivalist psychology of people who have been robbed of their moral and intellectual compass . . . brilliantly chilling . . . <i>The Four Books</i> captures an aspect of Chinese life which is hard to imagine and understand for a foreigner, and Yan&#x2019;s skilful depiction reaffirms why he is China&#x2019;s most heralded and censored modern writer." <i><b>The South China Morning Post</b></i><br><br>"<i>The Four Books</i> should be celebrated for its originality. . . . A fascinating approach to a daring and interesting subject." <i><b>The Harvard Crimson</b></i><br><br>"One of contemporary Chinese literature's richest, wittiest, most seductive and powerful novels. . . . A joy to read." <i><b>The Saturday Paper</b></i><b> (Au)</b><br><br>"A searing, allegorical view of Chinese society during some of the darkest moments of the Mao era. . . .

In 1660 Locke became lecturer on Greek, in 1662 on Rhetoric, and in 1664 he went as secretary to an Embassy to Brandenburg. While a student he turned from the subtleties of Aristotle and the schoolmen, had studied Descartes and Bacon. Then, becoming attracted to experimental science, studied medicine, and practiced a little in Oxford. His mind had been much exercised by questions of morals and government, and in 1667 he wrote his Essay on Toleration. If not a very profound or original philosopher Locke was a calm, sensible, and reasonable writer, and his books were very influential on the English thought of his day, as well as on the French philosophy of the next century. His style is plain and clear, but lacking in brightness and variety.&#39;Macpherson provides for his readers a tightly written, meaty, and often invigorating critical assessment of Locke&#39;s argument.

Told by the comic legend Harvey Pekar, his frequent artistic collaborator Ed Piskor, and a range of artists and writers, including the feminist comic creator Trina Robbins and the <i>Mad</i> magazine artist Peter Kuper, <i>The Beats</i> takes us on a wild tour of a generation that, in the face of mainstream American conformity and conservatism, became known for its determined uprootedness, aggressive addictions, and startling creativity and experimentation.&nbsp;What began among a small circle of friends in New York and San Francisco during the late 1940s and early 1950s laid the groundwork for a literary explosion, and this striking anthology captures the storied era in all its incarnations&#x2014;from the Benzedrine-fueled antics of Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Burroughs to the painting sessions of Jay DeFeo&#x2019;s disheveled studio, from the jazz hipsters to the beatnik chicks, from Chicago&#x2019;s College of Complexes to San Francisco&#x2019;s famed City Lights bookstore.

What emerges is a brilliant collage of&#x2014;and tribute to&#x2014;a generation, in a form and style that is as original as its subject.</p><p><b>Harvey Pekar</b> is best known for his graphic autobiography, American Splendor, based on his long-running comic-book series that was turned into a 2003 film of the same name. <b>Paul Buhle</b> is a senior lecturer at Brown University.&#x201c;Editor Paul Buhle&#x2019;s graphic history <i>The Beats</i>&#x2014;with riffs from cats such as Harvey Pekar and Trina Robbins&#x2014;burns like a Roman candle.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Vanity Fair</i><i></i>&nbsp;<i></i>&#x201c;<i>The Beats</i> is as fresh and pertinent as the latest scholarly history, only far more entertaining.&#x201d; &#x2014;Studs Terkel&nbsp;&#x201c;A new angle on a familiar story . . .

A friend, Renate, had told me about her trip to Vienna where she was born, and of her childhood relationships to statues. She told me stories of her childhood, her relationship to her father, her first love.</p><p>I begin the novel with:</p><p><i>Vienna was the city of statues. They were as numerous as the people who walked the streets. They stood on the top of the highest towers, law down on stone tombs, sat on horseback, kneeled, prayed, fought animals and wars, danced, drank wine and read books made of stone. They adorned cornices like the figureheads of old ships. They stood in the heart of fountains glistening with water as if they had just been born. They sat under the trees in the parks summer and winter. Some wore costumes of other periods, and some no clothes at all. Men, women, children, kings, dwarfs, gargoyles, unicorns, lions, clowns, heroes, wise men, prophets, angels, saints, and soldiers preserved for Vienna a vision of eternity.</i></p><p><i>As a child Renate could see them from her bedroom window. At night, when the white muslin curtains fluttered out like ballooning wedding dresses, she heard them whispering like figures which had been petrified by a spell during the day and came alive only at night. Their silence by day taught her to read their frozen lips as one reads the messages of deaf mutes. On rainy days their granite eye sockets shed tears mixed with soot.</i></p><p><i>Renate would never allow anyone to tell her the history of the statues, or to identify them. This would have situated them in the past. She was convinced that people did not die, they became statues. They were people under a spell and if she were watchful enough they would tell her who they were and how they lived now.</i></p><p>If I had been asked then what was going to follow the description of the statues, I could not have answered. I was fascinated by the image of these many statues and of the child Renate inventing stories about them and dialoguing with them. It may have been that this image expressed the feeling I often had that people appear to us as a one-dimensional statue until we go deeper into their life story. People <i>are</i> like mute statues under a spell of <i>appearance,</i> and static, until we let them whisper their secrets. And this only happens at night. That is, when we are able to dream, imagine, and explore the unconscious. We see the external self. Because <i>Collages</i> took its images from painting and sculpture, I liked the idea that sculpture and painting could become animated, speaking, confessing, and then in daylight returning to their previous forms as statues or paintings. They spoke only to the artist. To me it meant dramatizing our relation to art, one feeding the other, the interrelation between human beings and the artist&#x2019;s conception of them. In daylight (consciousness) we catch them all only in one attitude, one form. At night, we discover their lives.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Anaï¿½s Nin, &#x201c;The Novel of the Future,&#x201d; (Athens: Ohio University Press, 1986), 128</p></p><p>Collages is a handful of perfectly told fables, and prose which is so daringly elaborate, so accurately timed...using words as magnificently colorful, evocative and imagist as any plastic combination or canvas but as mysteriously idiosyncratic as any abstract.<p><b>Anaï¿½s Nin</b> (1903&#x2013;1977) is an iconic literary figure and one of the most notable experimental writers of the twentieth century.

From his townhouse in Bern, and in clandestine meetings in restaurants, back roads, and lovers&#x2019; bedrooms, Dulles met with and facilitated the plots of Germans who were trying to destroy the country&#x2019;s leadership. Their underground network exposed Dulles to the political maneuverings of the Soviets, who were already competing for domination of Germany, and all of Europe, in the post-war period.<br> <br>Scott Miller&#x2019;s fascinating <i>Agent 110</i> explains how leaders of the German Underground wanted assurances from Germany&#x2019;s enemies that they would treat the country humanely after the war. If President Roosevelt backed the resistance, they would overthrow Hitler and shorten the war. But Miller shows how Dulles&#x2019;s negotiations fell short. Eventually he was placed in charge of the CIA in the 1950s, where he helped set the stage for US foreign policy. With his belief that the ends justified the means, Dulles had no qualms about consorting with Nazi leadership or working with resistance groups within other countries to topple governments.<br> <br>Now Miller brings to life this exhilarating, and pivotal, period of world history&#x2014;of desperate renegades in a dark and dangerous world where spies, idealists, and traitors match wits and blows to ensure their vision of a perfect future.</p><p>Scott Miller&nbsp;serves as&nbsp;FranklinCovey&#x2019;s&nbsp;Executive Vice President of Thought Leadership and is the host of&nbsp;<i>On Leadership&nbsp;With&nbsp;Scott Miller</i>&#x2014;a weekly leadership webcast, podcast,&nbsp;and newsletter.

Stretching across the screen, from the English Channel to the Soviet Union, the Nazi reach and terror seemed unstoppable. One small pocket, though, was carefully illustrated to show an area that did not belong to the Germans. Pointing through the projector&#x2019;s flickering light, parents might have noted to their children that the missing piece of the Third Reich was Switzerland, that country of soaring peaks, fields of cows, and alpine meadows, just as they may have seen in Shirley Temple&#x2019;s 1937 movie Heidi.<br> <br>What few American parents knew was that Switzerland was home to a thriving community of spies. Secret agents&#x2014;German, Hungarian, Japanese, British, American, Italian, Chinese, Polish, and Soviet&#x2014;had been drawn to the country for years for its long-standing policy of neutrality and its geographic position at the heart of Europe. By day, secret agents plotted one another&#x2019;s political destruction. By night, at the Hotel Bellevue Palace, they laughed and drank at tables within easy earshot of each other. At the golf course, intelligence agents politely allowed their faster counterparts from enemy nations to play through. At fragrant bakeries, they patiently stood in the same lines for the morning&#x2019;s croissants.<br> <br>Where so many spies congregated, so did their camp followers, scoundrels hoping to make a quick franc peddling information of suspect quality, resistance fighters, and women willing to trade their bodies to advance their cause. Everyone, or so it seemed, was a double agent trying to keep all the stories straight.<br> <br>On a chilly Sunday in January 1943, an American with the physique of a lifelong tennis player strode through the quiet streets of the nation&#x2019;s financial capital, Zurich. Allen Dulles, a portrait of confidence, had been in Switzerland only a couple of months in the employ of the US government. To anyone who would ask, he would say he served as a special assistant to the American head of mission, Leland Harrison. The claim made sense for someone like him, a suitable way for a former diplomat to do his part for the war effort. Yet aiding the American minister was not the reason he had come to Switzerland. William Donovan, the head of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the fledgling American intelligence service, had assigned him to get a Swiss station up and running to spy on Nazi Germany.<br> <br>At age forty-nine, Dulles was one of those rare individuals whose vintage only improved with the years. His hair, though slightly thinning, was still sufficient for a respectable part, and his mustache was full. A Wall Street lawyer and a member of a family that ranked among America&#x2019;s ruling class&#x2014;two relatives had served as secretaries of state&#x2014;he projected a worldliness that was unusual for an American. Maybe it was the blue eyes that twinkled behind round rimless glasses or the disarming pipe perched between his teeth, but Dulles could, when he wished, assume an engaging personality that made others take an instant liking.<br> <br>Dulles was in Zurich to meet a man he had been warned to avoid, a German named Hans Bernd Gisevius. Like Dulles, Gisevius lived in Switzerland under false pretenses. Officially he carried the title of vice consul attached to the German mission in Zurich. Espionage circles knew that he was really an agent of the Abwehr, the intelligence arm of the German military. As a newcomer, Dulles was an obvious target for Germans like Gisevius who feasted on inexperienced spies. Yet exactly because he was new to town and eager to establish an intelligence network as quickly as possible, Dulles had kept an open mind. &#x201c;Our countries were at war. A meeting between us was hardly according to protocol,&#x201d; Dulles later wrote. Checking with what few contacts he had been able to develop, Dulles concluded that if he kept his guard up, meeting the German spy was worth the risk.<br> <br>Greeting Gisevius at an undisclosed location, Dulles was confronted with a solidly built, handsome man who was more than a little imposing. Standing some six feet four inches, he was known to his friends as &#x201c;Der Lange&#x201d; or &#x201c;the tall one.&#x201d; At first blush, Gisevius exuded the air of an academic. With his round thick glasses, he had the look of a &#x201c;learned professor of Latin or Greek.&#x201d; Yet he had spent virtually his entire career in German security and police services, including the Prussian Gestapo, and he bore the imprints of the profession. His manner was stiff, formal, and guarded, and he frequently came across as arrogant. One who knew him well attributed a &#x201c;brutal&#x201d; aspect to his appearance.<br> <br>Gisevius had come to Dulles with a clear agenda. He explained that there were many brave souls in Germany who wanted to rid their country of Adolf Hitler and were ready to take action. All they needed was help from the Americans, which they hoped Dulles could arrange. They could kill or depose the Fï¿½hrer, but Gisevius and his friends needed to know whether Washington would negotiate a peace treaty with a new German government. Overthrowing their Fascist dictator without such assurances, he said, could lead to revolution and chaos.<br> <br>Dulles dismissed Gisevius that night without any record that he offered the slightest encouragement. Gisevius would soon travel to Berlin to join fellow conspirators in a bold plot, while Dulles dove into what he considered more important projects.<br> <br>ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½<br> <br>Though Dulles didn&#x2019;t take Gisevius seriously that evening, much of what the German said rang true. Allied intelligence services knew there were pockets of resistance within Germany. In company canteens, noisy local beer halls, and even closed-door meeting rooms at the German army headquarters in Berlin, groups of men and women had gathered to plot against Hitler since the first of the eerie torchlight parades in 1933 that signaled the Nazis&#x2019; rise to power. Their motivations were varied&#x2014;religious leaders detested the Fï¿½hrer&#x2019;s merciless attacks on Jews; politicians, especially those on the left, hated his attitude toward the Communists; and army officers were terrified he would ruin the Wehrmacht. All feared that Hitler was leading their beloved country to ruin.<br> <br>Some resistance members had been making their way to the West to issue warnings. In the late 1930s, several had traveled to Switzerland to open lines of communication with the British government. Others had turned to contacts in the British aristocracy. One, a Munich lawyer, Josef Mï¿½ller, made contact with the British using Pope Pius XII as an intermediary. Still another, the German politician Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, had turned to Jakob Wallenberg, a member of the Swedish banking family, to reach out to Western capitals.<br> <br>Yet Dulles had reason to be wary about Gisevius. In November 1939, the Abwehr had captured two British spies near the Dutch town of Venlo, after German agents had similarly approached them to work together. Although it was unlikely the Germans would try to kidnap Dulles himself&#x2014;the Swiss took a dim view of such lawlessness&#x2014;it was possible, even likely, that Gisevius&#x2019;s purpose was to worm his way into Dulles&#x2019;s confidence to gain information that could be used to break American codes or discover the identity of Allied agents.<br> <br>Another reason for caution was the nature of Dulles&#x2019;s assignment. His superiors had made it clear before he left Washington that he was to lead psychological campaigns to demoralize the German people and troops, to learn what he could about Nazi secret weapons, and to deliver order of battle intelligence such as enemy troop strengths. Dulles also hoped to work with members of resistance movements, and he had access to money to help fund their operations. But engaging in high-level political negotiations exceeded his brief.</p><h2>Iceland (3) (Classic Geology in Europe)</h2><p><p>As a concise and authoritative field guide toan exceptional natural laboratory, this title in the Classic Geology in Europe series will be an essential companion for those visiting Iceland to observe the Earth in action.

I wish to learn from each of you your reasons for being truthful. Adrian, what is your reason for being truthful?ADRIAN: My reason is quite simple. It says in the Bible that one should be truthful, and I take the Bible seriously. Since my greatest duty on earth is obedience to the will of God and God commands me to be truthful, my reason for being truthful is obvious.MORALIST: Very good! And you, Bernard, why are you truthful?BERNARD: I also take the Bible very seriously. The one thing in the Bible that impresses me most is the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have others do unto you. Since I wish others to be truthful with me, I am accordingly truthful with them.MORALIST: Excellent! And you, Carey, what are your reasons for being truthful?CAREY: My reasons have nothing to do with religion. I am truthful on purely ethical grounds. I desire to be virtuous, and since truthfulnessis one of the virtues and lying is one of the vices, then to be virtuous it is necessary for me to be truthful.EPISTEMOLOGIST (<i>who is, strangely enough, in this group though he wasn't invited):</i> I find this reason peculiar! Carey evidently doesn't value truthfulness in its own right but only because it belongs to the more general category of virtue, and it is this more general category that he values. Indeed, his very way of putting it: "To be virtuous it is necessary for me to be truthful," his very use of the word <i>necessary</i> suggests that he is reluctant to be truthful but is nevertheless truthful only as a <i>means</i> to another end, that end being virtue itself. This is what I find so strange! Furthermore, I think--MORALIST: Sorry to interrupt you, old man, but it was not my intention that we criticize the speakers as they go along. I prefer on this occasion to let the speakers simply state their views; we can reserve critical analysis for another time. And so, Daniel, why are you truthful?DANIEL: My reasons are also nonreligious--or at least nontheistic. I am a great admirer of the ethics of Immanuel Kant. I realize that his ethical attitudes were, at least psychologically, tied up with his religious ones, but many people who reject Kant's theistic views nevertheless accept his moral ones. I am one such person. I am truthful out of obedience to Kant's categorical imperative, which states that one should never perform any act unless one wills that act to be universal law. Since it is obvious that if everybody lied there would be utter chaos, I clearly cannot will it to be universal law that everybody lies. The categorical imperative hence implies that I, too, should not lie.MORALIST: Very good! And you, Edward, what are your reasons for being truthful?EDWARD: My reasons are purely humanistic and utilitarian. It is obvious that truthfulness is beneficial to society, and since my main interest in life is to benefit society, then accordingly I am truthful.MORALIST: Splendid! And you, Frank, why are you truthful?FRANK: In order to live up to my name. Since my name is Frank, then it behooves me to be frank with people.MORALIST: Stop being facetious! This is a serious symposium! What about you, George, why are you truthful?GEORGE: Because I am a selfish bastard!MORALIST: What!GEORGE: Exactly! The few times I have lied, I have ended up getting it in the neck! It's not other people I care about; I care about myself. I don't want any trouble! I have simply learned from hard and bitter experience that honesty is the best policy.MORALIST: What about you, Harry?HARRY: My ethical orientation is rather similar to that of George. But instead of using the rather harsh phrase <i>selfish bastard</i>, I would prefer to classify myself as a hedonist; I perform only those acts calculated to maximize my pleasure in life. I am not as fanatical as George; I place <i>some</i> value on other people's happiness but not as much as on my own. And I have much rational evidence that in the long run I will be happiest if I am always truthful.MORALIST: So you are a hedonist! In other words, you are truthful because it gives you pleasure to be truthful, and you avoid lying because you find lying painful. Is that it?HARRY: Not quite. I do not necessarily derive <i>immediate</i> pleasure from being truthful. Indeed, sometimes it is immediately painful. But I am a thoughtful and rational person; I am always willing to sacrifice my immediate pleasures for the sake of my ultimate good. I always plan ahead. Therefore, I am truthful since as I told you I have rational evidence that my being truthful is best for me in the long run.MORALIST: What is this evidence?HARRY: That is too long a story for us to go into now. I think we should instead hear the views of the other speakers.MORALIST: Very good. What about you, Irving?IRVING: I am also a hedonist.MORALIST: That so far makes three of you! George, Harry, and you.IRVING: Yes, but I am not like the others.MORALIST: How SO?IRVING: You mean how not! By temperament, I feel very different from George, and unlike Harry I am not the rational type of hedonist. Rather, I am a mystical hedonist.MORALIST: A mystical hedonist? That's a strange combination! I have never heard that one before. What on earth do you mean by a <i>mystical</i> hedonist?IRVING <i>(sadly):</i> I don't know!MORALIST: You don't know? How come you don't know?IRVING: Well, you see, since I am a mystical hedonist, I am also a hedonist. I feel that if I knew what I meant by a mystical hedonist, I would be less happy than I am not knowing what I mean. Therefore, on hedonistic grounds it is better that I do not know what I mean by a mystical hedonist.MORALIST: But if you don't even know what you <i>mean</i> by a mystical hedonist, how can you possibly know that you are one?IRVING: Good question! As you say, since I am unable to define a <i>mystical hedonist,</i> I couldn't possibly have rational grounds for knowing that I am one. Yet, in fact, I <i>do</i> know that I am one. This is precisely where my mysticism comes inMORALIST: Oh, my God! This is too complicated for <i>me!</i>IRVING: Me, too.MORALIST: At any rate, what is your reason for being truthful? The same as Harry's?IRVING: The reason is the same, but my <i>justification</i> of the reason is totally different.MORALIST: I don't understand. Can you explain this?IRVING: Why, yes. Like Harry, I believe that my telling the truth is best for me in the long run. But unlike Harry, I have no rationalevidence for this. Indeed, all the rational evidence I have is quite to the contrary. Therefore, the <i>rational</i> thing for me to do is to lie. But I have a strange intuition that I had best tell the truth. And being a mystic, I trust my intuition more than my reason. Hence, I tell the truth.MORALIST: Most extraordinary! And what about you, Jacob?JACOB: My truthfulness is a matter of contingency, not choice.MORALIST: I don't understand you!JACOB: I have simply never had the opportunity to lie.MORALIST: I understand you even less!JACOB: My attitude is as follows: Obviously, no one in his right mind would ever think of lying to his friends; it only makes sense to lie to one's enemies. If any enemy ever threatened to harm me, I would not for a moment hesitate to lie to divert his attack. But since I have no enemies and never have had any enemies, the opportunity for me to lie has never presented itself.MORALIST: How singular! And what about you, Kurt; what are your reasons for being truthful?KURT: I have only one reason. I am truthful simply because I <i>feel</i> like being truthful; I have no other reason than that.MORALIST: But that is no reason!KURT: Of course it is a reason! As I just told you, it's my <i>only</i> reason.MORALIST: But your reason is no good!KURT: Whoever said that I had a <i>good</i> reason? I said that it's my <i>reason</i>; I didn't say it was a <i>good</i> one.MORALIST: Oh, but just because you feel like being truthful, it does not follow that you <i>should</i> be truthful. Of course, I believe that you should be truthful but not merely because you <i>feel</i> like it. There are many things I feel like doing, but I don't do them because I know that I shouldn't do them. Not everything that one feels like doing is necessarily right! So why is your feeling like being truthful an adequate justification of your being truthful?EPISTEMOLOGIST: I thought we weren't supposed to argue with the speakers.MORALIST: I shall ignore that remark. I repeat my question: Just because you feel like being truthful, why does it follow that you should be truthful?KURT: <i>Should</i> be truthful? Who the hell ever said that <i>I should</i> be truthful?MORALIST: Don't tell me now that you believe that you <i>shouldn't</i> be truthful!KURT: Of course not! I don't give a damn what I should or shouldn't do!MORALIST: Oh, come now; surely you want to do what you believe you ought to do!KURT: What I <i>ought</i> to do! I couldn't care less! Look, man, I don't give one hoot for all your ethics, morality, religion, rights and wrongs, oughts and shoulds! As I told you, I feel like being truthful and that is my only reason.MORALIST: But I am trying to explain to you that that reason is inadequate!KURT: I don't give a damm whether it is adequate or not! It so happens I <i>feel</i> like being truthful! Do you mind?MORALIST: No, I don't mind. I don't mind at all. Only you needn't be so belligerent about it! Now what about you, Larry? Why are you truthful?LARRY: Why does a tree grow?MORALIST: Look now, we are not here to play mystical games with each other. I asked you a serious question.LARRY: And I gave you a serious answer.MORALIST: Oh, come now, what does a tree growing have to do with your being truthful?LARRY: More perhaps than you realize.MORALIST: I wish that you would stop giving these cryptic responses! What are you, one of these Zen Buddhists or something?LARRY: Yes.MORALIST: Oh, no wonder you talk in this strange manner! But you can't tell me why you are truthful?LARRY: Can you tell me why a tree grows?MORALIST: I still don't see what the growth of a tree has to do with your being truthful.LARRY: More perhaps than you realize.MORALIST: So we are back to that again! You Zen men are the most frustrating creatures to talk to!LARRY: In that case, why do you talk to us? But I'm glad you called me a <i>creature.</i> That at least shows that you have <i>some</i> insight into the true relationship between me and a tree.MORALIST: Oh, really now, in what significant way are you like a tree?LARRY: In what significant way am I different?MORALIST: Oh, surely now, you regard yourself as a <i>little</i> more significant than a tree, don't you?LARRY: Not at all.MORALIST: But do you not realize that a tree is at a lower stage of life than a man?LARRY: I find your use of the word <i>lower</i> ill advised. It is psychologically misleading and sets an emotional tone that is tantamount to begging the question. I would prefer to say that a tree is at an <i>earlier</i> stage of life.MORALIST: Let's not be pedantic and quibble about words! In this context, <i>lower</i> and <i>earlier</i> mean exactly the same thingLARRY: Oh no they don't! <i>Objectively</i> they may have the same meaning in this context but <i>subjectively</i> they certainly do not. One would say that a child is at an earlier stage of life than an adult but surely not at a lower stage This latter mode of speech gives the impression that an adult is superior to a child, which I don't believe many would wish to do.MORALIST: All right, have it your way; so you're <i>not</i> superior to a tree. But why are you truthful? And please don't answer my question again with the question, "Why does a tree grow?"LARRY: If you tell me why a tree grows, then perhaps I can tell you why I am truthful.MORALIST: I still don't see the connection between the two! Why must I first tell you why a tree grows?LARRY: Because I have great difficulty understanding your use of the word why. I was hoping that if you told me why a tree grows then I could gather enough data on your use of this word to help me answer your question more satisfactorily.MORALIST: Oh, so our difficulty is semantical! In that case, I'll use a different word. What is your <i>reason</i> for being truthful?LARRY: Does everything have to have a reason?MORALIST: Well of course!LARRY: Really now! Does a tree have a reason for growing?MORALIST: Of course not. At least, I don't think so.LARRY: Then why should I have a reason for being truthful?MORALIST: Because you are not a tree!LARRY: So because I am not a tree, it follows that I should have a reason for being truthful?MORALIST: Oh heavens, you are only confusing matters! Look, a tree is not a conscious being; it has no free will and makes no choices. So one would hardly expect a tree to have a reason for growing, but one would expect you to have a reason for what you do!LARRY: I grant you that if I were not conscious then I would not possibly have a reason for <i>anything</i> I do. But it does not therefore follow that because I <i>am</i> conscious I must have a reason for <i>everything</i> I do. In particular, I have absolutely no reason for being truthful.MORALIST: No reason? None at all?LARRY: None whatsoever!MORALIST: Fantastic! In other words, you are in the same category as Kurt. You feel like being truthful and that is the only reason you are.LARRY: No, no, not at all! You totally miss my point! As Kurt told you, his feeling like being truthful is, for him, his <i>reason</i> for being truthful. But I have no reason at all!MORALIST: You mean that you don't even feel like being truthful?LARRY: What a strange non sequitur! Of course I feel like being truthful; otherwise I wouldn't be truthful.MORALIST: So I was right! That <i>is</i> your reason for being truthful.LARRY: I am sorry, but you are still confused. I both feel like being truthful and am truthful but there is no evidence that either of these two phenomena is the reason of the other.MORALIST: Look, I just can't believe that you have <i>no reason at all</i> for being truthful! You <i>must</i> have a reason; you just don't know what it is!LARRY: At this point, I am not sure just which of several possible meanings of the word <i>reason</i> you have in mind. When you ask the reason for my being truthful, are you asking for my <i>motive</i> or <i>purpose</i> in being truthful, or are you seeking the <i>cause</i> of my truthfulness? Or are you perhaps asking whether I am tru...</p><h2>T.S. Eliot</h2><p>Peter Ackroyd&#39;s biography gives new insights into Eliot&#39;s life and work.

Chocolate was consumed unrefined and unprocessed as a rather bitter, fatty drink for the wealthy elite until the late 19th century, when the Swiss discovered a way to blend it with milk and unleashed a product that would conquer every market in the world. Thereafter, one of the great global business rivalries unfolded as each chocolate maker attempted to dominate its domestic market and innovate new recipes for chocolate that would set it apart from its rivals. The contest was full of dramatic contradictions: The Cadburys were austere Quakers who found themselves making millions from an indulgent product; Kitty Hershey could hardly have been more flamboyant yet her husband was moved by the Cadburys tradition of philanthropy.

One of the major contributors to our understanding of the subject is Fritz Winckel. When this book first appeared in German in 1960, reviewers pressed for an English translation. This Dover volume is an answer to that demand: it makes Professor "Winckel's important study generally available to English-language readers for the very first time." It has been extensively revised and updated by the author.<br>In his thought-provoking study, Professor Winckel applies the findings of technical researches in acoustics to the practice of music, covering many different aspects of recent psychoacoustical researches: the evaluation of loudness and the dissolution power of the car; the influence of the acoustical properties of the concert hall on the hearing process; the function of time variation and rhythm in musical perception; the evaluation of the sound spectrum including the unharmonic components. He surveys extensively the German and English literature in the field, organizing his information into chapters on stationary sound, the onset behavior of sound, the concept of space, the concept of time, the evaluation of sound through the hearing mechanism, unclarity in musical structures, simultaneously sounding tones, electroacoustic sound structure, and the effect of music on the listener.<br>This book should prove equally useful to acousticians, sound engineers, and others working in this area of applied physics and to composers, performers, and musicologists concerned with the technical aspects of music. Psychologists working in the field of sense perception will also find much of value here.<br>New translation by Thomas Binkley of the 1960 German edition of <i>Phï¿½nomene des musikalischen Hï¿½rens, </i>with revisions and corrections by the author.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>On Meaning: Selected Writings in Semiotic Theory (Theory and History of Literature)</h2><p>A. J. Greimas is a leading thinker in semiotics who has modeled and shaped the discipline over the last twenty-five years. His theories of discourse display the rigor of science without ignoring the concerns of traditional narrative analysis. The essays in this volume are takes from three major works Du sens (1970), Semiotique et sciences sociales (1976), and Du sens II (1983). Available here for the first time in English, the selections trace the development of Greimas&#39;s work in literary, historical, ethnological, sociological, philosophical, and scientific discourses. From the outset, Greimassian semiotics seeks to answer these questions: What are the conditions for the production of meaning, and how can the transformation of meaning into signification be described? in the first four essays Greimas grounds the anthropomorphic dimension of the theory as a whole and establishes the basic form of narrative grammar. The next six essays explore semio-narrative and surface structures, constructing modal and aspectual grammars. Finally, the last four essays examine communication, sociolinguistics, history, and ethnosemiotics.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>The Modern Italian Cook</h2><p>Joseph Trivelli, the co-head chef of the widely acclaimed River Cafe, reveals how to make hearty, comforting and delicious Italian food in this glorious cookbook.</p><p></p><h2>The Texas Post Office Murals: Art for the People (Joe and Betty Moore Texas Art Series)</h2><p>Walk into any of sixty post offices or federal buildings in the state of Texas and you may be greeted by a surprising sight: magnificent mural art on the lobby walls.<br><br>In the midst of the Great Depression, a program was born that would not only give work to artists but also create beauty and optimism for a people worn down by hardship and discouragement.

First published in 1938, this story of a housepainter who is sent a male penguin by the great Admiral Drake, and who, thanks to the arrival of a female penguin, soon has twelve penguins living in his house, has amused and enchanted generations of children and their parents.</p><p>More than 60 years have not dated this wonderfully absurd tale--it still makes kids (and parents) laugh out loud. Poor Mr. Popper isn't exactly unhappy; he just wishes he had seen something of the world before meeting Mrs. Popper and settling down. Most of all, he wishes he had seen the Poles, and spends his spare time between house-painting jobs reading all about polar explorations. Admiral Drake, in response to Mr. Popper's fan letter, sends him a penguin; life at 432 Proudfoot Avenue is never the same again. From one penguin living in the icebox, the Popper family grows to include 12 penguins, all of whom must be fed. Thus is born "Popper's Performing Penguins, First Time on Any Stage, Direct from the South Pole." Their adventures while on tour are hilarious, with numerous slapstick moments as the penguins disrupt other acts and invade hotels. Classic chapter-a-night fun. (Ages 5 to 10) <i>--Richard Farr</i>Before his death in 1948, Richard Atwater was a newspaper columnist and a professor of Greek. He is best known for writing <em>Mr. Popper's Penguins </em>with his wife, Florence, who finished the novel when he fell ill.

McManus </b>has published novels, plays, and more than a dozen collections of his humor columns from<i>Outdoor Life</i> and other magazines. There are nearly two million copies of his book in print, including his bestselling T<i>he Shoot Canoes, Don't They?</i>; <i>The Night the Bear Ate Goombaw</i>; and <i>A Fine and Pleasant Misery</i>. He divides his time between Spokane, Washington and Idaho.Never Sniff A Gift Fish <br> Blowing Smoke Many people think that my reputation as a great outdoorsman is a product of inherent athletic ability. Nothing could be further from the truth, which is that I have been cursed since birth with an extraordinary lack of coordination. For years my fly-casting technique was compared, rather banally I might add, to an old lady fighting off a bee with a broom handle. My canoe paddling raised shouts of alarm among onlookers, who assumed I was trying to repel an assault by a North American cousin of the Loch Ness monster. My attempts to pitch the family tent terrorized entire campgrounds. As for marksmanship, any game I happened to bring into camp was routinely examined by my disbelieving companions for powder burns. ("The man has stealth," they would say. "Who else could place the muzzle of a rifle to the head of a sleeping mule-deer buck? Who else could still miss?") For years I suffered the ridicule of my fellow sportsmen over what they perceived to be my ineptitude. Then one day I happened to recall a lovable old college administrator I had once served time under, Dr. Milburn Snodgrass. That casual recollection was to advance outdoor sports by a hundred years. Doc Snodgrass had taken up pipe smoking as a young man and turned it into a highly successful career, eventually rising to the position of dean. Obviously, his success was not due merely to pipe smoking. No, he was also the master of two facial expressions: thoughtful and bemused. Those were the total ingredients of his success. The man was dumb. It is my considered opinion that if intelligence were crankcase oil, his would not have wet the tip of the dipstick let alone reached the add-one-quart mark. But he was an excellent dean. No matter what problem was brought before Doc Snodgrass, his response was to sit back and puff on his pipe, alternating between thoughtful and bemused expressions. The effect suggested that Doc was bemused by a problem so ridiculously simple and was giving thought to firing the nincompoop who dared bother him with it. The problem-bearer would laugh feebly, to indicate it was all a little joke, and then rush off to find the solution himself. People thought Snodgrass was a genius and often wondered what great ideas he was mulling over as he puffed his pipe and looked thoughtful and bemused. Eventually, I would learn the truth: Doc Snodgrass was not smart enough to mull. One example will serve to illustrate the effectiveness of the dean's approach to human relations. During a campus uprising, the students demanded that the college administration do away with Poverty,War, and Mashed Turnips in the Commissary, although not necessarily in that order. Doc Snodgrass appeared suddenly on the steps of the administration building, seemingly to confront the chanting mob but more likely because he had mistaken the exit for the door to the restroom. (His thoughtful expression was probably due at first to his wondering why so many students of both sexes were in the men's room.) As he fumbled about in his pockets looking for his tobacco pouch--the search for the source of the Nile took scarcely longer--the students fell silent, no doubt saving their breath for the purpose of shouting down the words of wisdom they expected to be forthcoming from the dean. (Youths are not called callow for nothing.) The pouch at last found, the dean began to fill his pipe, tamping and filling, tamping and filling, and all the while looking extremely thoughtful. Then he began probing his pockets for a match. Finally, an exasperated student in guerrilla attire lunged forward and thrust upon him a disposable lighter, little realizing that the dean was confounded by all such modern technology. His efforts to ignite the lighter by scratching it against a brick wall produced a good laugh from the students and a consensus among them that anyone with a sense of humor like that couldn't be such a bad guy after all. The mood of the crowd lightened. A game of Frisbee broke out. Someone threw a football. A coed burned her bra. Having solved the riddle of the lighter, and tortured the tobacco into a state of combustion, Snodgrass began sucking away on his pipe as he looked increasingly thoughtful. He was, as I say, a master of the thoughtful expression. Even the hardliners among the students seemed unable to resist the impression that the dean wascontemplating the eradication of Poverty, War, and Mashed Turnips. The crowd began to disperse, its members exchanging among themselves the opinion that the dean had not only a great sense of humor but a mind "like a steel trap." The truth was, he had a mind like flypaper, and not very good flypaper at that. His total intellectual arsenal consisted of his pipe and those two facial expressions. The import of the dean's pipe did not strike me immediately, but when it did, I rushed out and bought myself a pipe and tobacco and began practicing my expressions. As a direct consequence of these efforts, I began rising through the professorial ranks as if by levitation. The ugly rumor that I had flunked three successive IQ tests (there were a lot of trick questions) was silenced once and for all. Faculty and students alike began referring to me as one who had a mind like a steel trap. And I continued to puff my pipe and look alternately bemused and thoughtful as promotion after promotion was thrust upon me. Still, not all was well. There was the problem of my ineptitude at outdoor sports. Then one day I was struck by a marvelous idea. If my pipe and expressions had worked so well in advancing my career, why wouldn't they be equally effective in something worthwhile, such as hunting and fishing? The very next weekend, on a fishing trip with Retch Sweeney and Fenton Quagmire, I took along my pipe and tobacco and, of course, my ability to become bemused or thoughtful at the drop of a hat. The fishing started out routinely, with Sweeney and Quagmire making snide remarks about my casting technique. For the most part, however, they confined their merriment to a few chortles, saving the belly laughs forthe embarrassing predicament that my lack of coordination invariably lands me in. Presently, I spotted a promising patch of water, but it was made almost inaccessible because of thick brush and high banks on one side and a monstrous logjam on the other. For that very reason I guessed that the deep hole beneath the logjam probably hadn't been prospected recently by other anglers. As I studied the situation, I noticed a slender log jutting out through the brush on the bank, and I quickly calculated that by sitting on the end of this log I could cast over the hole and still remain concealed from the fish. Five minutes later I was perched somewhat precariously on the end of the log and, in fact, had already extracted a couple of plump trout from beneath the logjam. Sweeney and Quagmire, both as yet without a single strike, glared enviously at me and cursed my ingenuity. Now it was my turn to chortle. But right in the middle of my chortle, a huge rainbow zoomed out of the depths like a Polaris missile and detonated on my Black Gnat. This was exactly what I had been anticipating, and with lightning reflexes, I fell off the log and dropped fifteen feet into a bed of assorted boulders, none smaller than a breadbox. Even though my impact on the rocks caused me to wonder momentarily whether pelvic transplants had yet been perfected, I immediately arose without so much as a whimper, whipped out my pipe, and began stuffing it with tobacco. Already I detected the sounds of Sweeney and Quagmire crashing through the brush, possibly to determine if I had suffered any serious injury but more likely racing each other for the fishing spot I had so recently abandoned. In any case, I knew that great booming laughs were already gestating in their bellies.But I was ready. When their heads popped from the brush, I was calmly puffing on my pipe and looking thoughtfully up at the log. "You hurt?" Sweeney asked, traces of a smile already playing in the corners of his mouth. To such a question I normally would have snappishly replied, "No, you idiot, I've always been shaped like a potato chip!" Then would have come the wild howls of mirth, the ecstatic knee-slapping, and the attempts by Sweeney and Quagmire to re-create through mimicry some of my more extravagant moves during the course of the fall. But not this time. Calmly, I blew a puff of smoke toward them and displayed my bemused look. I then returned my thoughtful gaze to the log. I will not exaggerate the quality of my companions' mental processes by suggesting that they had flashes of insight. Nevertheless, I sensed some faint cognitive flickerings. "Whatcha do that for?" asked Quagmire, referring to my fall. "Yeah, you could've hurt yourself," Sweeney added, puzzled. Without replying, I continued to study the log thoughtfully, occasionally tossing a bemused look in the direction of my audience of two. Thoroughly befuddled, Quagmire and Sweeney at last wandered off to resume their fishing. They clearly were of the impression that I had deliberately planned and executed the fall from the log, possibly as a scientific experiment for a secret government agency. Success! Before shouting "Eureka!" however, I salved my injuries with emergency first aid, which consisted largely of defoliatingall the flora within a five-foot radius by hissing a stream of colorful expressions, and hopping about like a rain dancer trying to terminate a five-year drought. I could scarcely wait to test the pipe-and-two-expression ploy on wits quicker than those of Sweeney and Quagmire. The next weekend I was fishing alone on one of my favorite rivers and happened to run into a chap whose name turned out to be Shep. He obviously was an expert fly caster. His wrist would twitch and eighty feet of line would shoot toward the far bank, the tiny fly settling on the surface of the water as softly as a falling flake of dandruff. Even as I watched, he netted one of the finest trout I've ever seen taken from the river. "I think I'll keep this one," he said to me. "Now the big ones, I always release them." "Big ones?" I said, ogling his hefty catch. "Why, yes, I never take any of the big ones home myself. In fact, I often don't take home any small ones or middle-sized ones either." "Now, that's what I call true sportsmanship!" Shep said, casually dropping a fly three inches from the far bank. "Say, there's plenty of room here. Why don't you try a few casts yourself?" I had already dug out my pipe and lighted up. "Well, maybe, but first let me see you do that again, that, uh, cast of yours." He obliged me with a repeat performance, this time placing the fly a mere inch from the bank. I puffed my pipe and gave him my bemused look. "Something wrong?" he asked, a note of unease in his voice. I puffed away, looking bemused, as he made anotherawesome cast. He was showing definite signs of discomfort. "It's my elbow, isn't it?" he said. "I've never held my elbow the way you're supposed to. Maybe you can give me a couple of lessons." I knocked the ashes out of my pipe, changed to the thoughtful expression, and unleashed a powerful twenty-foot cast, the splash from which lifted a flock of crows cawing into the air from a nearby cornfield. Shep leaped back. "Are you okay? That was a nasty spasm you had just then." I silenced him with my bemused look. Then I stoked up my pipe again, alternating between thoughtful and bemused expressions. That destroyed the last of Shep's confidence. Ten minutes later I had him totally under my power and was even giving him a few casting tips. "There you go again," I scolded him, "casting over twenty-five feet. You have to learn control, man, learn controll" "I know," Shep said, whimpering, "but I just can't seem to get the knack of it." "Well, then, try this approach," I advised. "Just pretend you're a little old lady fighting off a bee with a broom handle." Naturally, I was delighted to discover that this bit of business with the pipe and two expressions not only transcended my lack of coordination but conveyed the impression that I was actually an expert angler. Within six months, I had applied the technique to all the other outdoor sports and found that it worked equally well. Now when I missed an easy shot at a pheasant, say, I would no longer hang my head and look embarrassed. Instead, I'd stick the pipe in my mouth and look bemused."You sure scared the heck out of that ol' ring-neck," my companion would say. "You've got to be darn good to miss a shot like that!" To date, my greatest achievement with the pipe and two expressions occurred on a backpacking trip into a wilderness area of the Rocky Mountains. Sweeney, Quagmire, and I were hiking along a trail when we came across a bear track of approximately the dimensions of a doormat. <i>"Bleep!"</i> hissed Sweeney. "Look at the size of that track!" "It's fr-fresh, too," whispered Quagmire, swiveling his head about. "L-looks like grizzly. Can't be far away, either." As I now do under all such circumstances, I dug out the pipe, calmly filled, tamped, and lighted it. Just then a grouse exploded from the brush at the edge of the trail and gave all three of us quite a start. Nevertheless, I puffed away on my pipe and looked bemused. Both Quagmire and Sweeney said later they were extremely impressed by my reaction. After all, it's no simple thing to puff a pipe and look bemused when you're running that fast.

For whereas most fossilization preserves hard tissues like bones, teeth, and shells, the geologic forces that formed the Burgess Shale also preserved soft tissues. The shale's fossil animals and plants are from the Cambrian, an era long before the dinosaurs during which a remarkable array of living things came into being. The site itself, in the Canadian Rockies of British Columbia, was discovered early in this century. Its full import wasn't grasped for many years, but the discoveries it eventually afforded, even if they don't include <i>T. Rex</i>es, certainly rival those made by any dinosaur hunter.

An introductory chapter defines what makes a bear a bear, and the author then takes a look at the three species of bears, their feeding behavior, social behavior, and territoriality, breeding, and hibernation. A very interesting chapter examines bears and humans, both in how humans study bears and in human-bear conflicts. The final chapter shows the reader how to interpret the signs left by bears when feeding, resting, or traveling.

Jasper Johns, Jr. (b. 1930) is an American contemporary artist who works primarily in painting and printmaking. Measures 8.5x11 inches.</p><p><b>Richard Francis,</b> was formerly the chief curator of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago and Senior Specialist in 20th Century Art at Christie's, New York.<br>Excerpt from: <b> <i>Jasper Johns</i> </b> <br> <br>Introduction<br> <br>"But the expression of our thoughts can always lie, for we may say one thing and mean another." Imagine the many different things which happen when we say one thing and mean another!&#x2014;Make the following experiment: say the sentence "It is hot in this room," and mean: "it is cold." Observe closely what you are doing.<br> <br>We could easily imagine beings who do their private thinking by means of "asides" and who manage their lies by saying one thing aloud, following it up by an aside which says the opposite.<br> <br>&#x2014; Ludwig Wittgenstein, <i>The Blue and Brown Books,</i> 1959<br> <br>Neither this book nor the work it describes can be considered easy. Jasper Johns' art is generated by complex and difficult ideas, and these cannot be avoided. We are seduced by the objects that Johns chooses to depict, ordinary, everyday things that appear unexpected or absurd as the subjects of this highly abstracted debate. Jasper Johns' art is treacherously difficult to write about. It is subtle, turned in upon itself, and hermetic, and critics are tempted to exaggerate to explain themselves. The allusions in the work are bound together in such a way that cutting the knot that ties them often leaves the critic with an unconnected bunch of ideas in his hands and the mystery still resolutely locked up.<br> <br>The works are difficult to explain because they deal, often, with the problems specific to making paintings. They are, in that respect, technical, and their vocabulary is that of picture making and comparable with the language of scientific discourse. They are also "modern" in the sense that Clement Greenberg described as modernist. They are part of a discipline "whose characteristic methods" are "to criticize the discipline itself." But modernism had also characteristically discarded objects and representation in favor of an abstracted art. Johns does much to subvert this.<br> <br>Johns complicates matters by using a few subjects several times and shifting his meaning on each occasion. He refers to the new idea that is his principal concern and backwards to his own earlier uses of the object. He does not work in series; rather he "reproduces" objects or images many times. Each motif carries for him, and ultimately for his viewer, complex meanings. These meanings are symbolic; they give off signals that are poignant and enigmatic about ideas only recently thought suitable as a subject for art. Donald Kuspit summed it up in 1981. Writing of Johns' recent drawings, he said: "He clings to the overly familiar until it becomes emblematic, a secret code to classified information. Read properly, Johns' images reveal unconscious attitudes about the world that impress themselves on our every recollection of it. In this work, it is not only certain worldly themes that persist, but certain attitudes as well."<br> <br>The use and reuse of a few ideas is so important to Johns that I will risk working from the particular to the general and trace the use of one image over twenty-two years. First, let us establish Johns' interest in repetition of the image. Christian Geelhaar asked him in an interview about his reuse of objects and images, and Johns replied:<br> <br>"Well perhaps because it interests me I think of it as a complex subject. In part it connects with Duchamp's idea that an artist has only a few ideas and...he's probably right...ones range is limited by ones interests and imagination and by ones passion...but without regard for limitations of that kind, I like to repeat an image in another medium to observe the play between the two: the image and the medium."<br> <br>In addition to that enjoyable interplay (which Johns admits that others might find boring and repetitious) he has always sought ideas that affect the viewer in more than one way. Irony is a particular weapon employed alongside a banal literalness. The viewer is unbalanced and doubtful about meanings in the work. Johns talks also about "the stress the image takes in different media" and suggests that it is possible to load the object with different meanings so that it works on several levels as the medium and context are changed.<br> <br>One of his most familiar images is the Savarin coffee can with brush handles poking out. <i>The Painted Bronze</i> (Savarin) of 1960 was carefully made in plaster, cast in bronze, and painted: it is a replica of a coffee can used for brushes in Johns' studio and was produced in the same year as the <i>Painted Bronze</i> (ale cans). (The latter was made in response to an aside by Willem de Kooning concerning Johns' dealer, Leo Castelli: "Somebody told me that Bill de Kooning said that you could give that son-of-a-bitch two beer cans and he could sell them. I thought, what a wonderful idea for a sculpture.") Johns later told Michael Crichton: "Doing the ale cans made me see other things around me, so I did the Savarin Can. I think what interested me was the coffee can used to hold turpentine for the brushes&#x2014;the idea of one thing mixed with another for a purpose." He made it painstakingly well, introducing illusionistic gestures, such as the silvered bronze rim of the tin, only to deny them with a thumbprint in the oil paint of the "can" itself, and offering us a studio still life and a representational sculpture. Johns returned to the Savarin motif in <i>1st Etchings</i> (1967-68) and again in the prints and paintings entitled <i>Decoy</i> (<i>Decoy</i> and <i>Decoy II</i>, 1971 and 1972). He called it by name in the Savarin lithograph that was also the poster for his retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1977. It appears in the Monotypes of 1978-79, in a lithograph of 1979-81, in the Monotypes of 1982, and in a recent painting, <i>Untitled</i> (1983).<br> <br>If we were to pursue a few thoughts (by no means exhaustive) about the development of this motif during his career, we might begin to uncover Johns' process of thought.<br> <br>In the <i>Painted Bronze,</i> are we to believe that the brushes have been or are about to be used again?&#x2014;i.e., are they active tools of the artists imagination or, more darkly, are they embalmed, both impotent and dead? Does the title <i>Painted Bronze</i> increase our uncertainty about the objects status? It is no more than a description of the medium of the work, but it is the title of both this work and the ale cans that preceded it. Johns asks us to recognize the exactitude of the language through the (incomplete) information it conveys: these are indeed painted bronzes, but when calling the works by name rather than looking at them we need to know the brand name to tell them apart. <i>Painted Bronze</i> (Savarin) is not the same as <i>Painted Bronze</i> (ale cans) or (Ballantine).<br> <br>In the Monotypes, does the motif become the artists representation of himself, adopted almost as a self-portrait? Johns alludes specifically in this series to a self-portrait lithograph by Edvard Munch, and the Savarin can occupies the same position as the artists face in the earlier work. Both Munch and Johns show the arm at the base; Munch draws a skeletal arm, Johns imprints his own arm and adds the initials EM.<br> <br>Johns' ironic positioning of the image in the center foreground parallels the Munch and offers other, ambiguous readings. It is also as a representative of Johns that it appears as a monochrome image in his most recent work; there it takes its place in relation to other ideas. It comes to stand for Johns' public persona and, by implication, for the corpus of his work as he lays it out in these pieces. What began as a playful manipulation of a joke (the ale cans) has been transformed first into a critique of sculptural meaning and then, after a long gestation, into an important element of the artists thought; at each stage its ambiguities have been compounded. Each time that Johns returns to it, he invests it with ideas specific to that period in his development: the "stress" that he talks about is as much here as in technical and formal preoccupations. On each occasion, too, the idea is modified by the beauty of the object.<br> <br>While Johns has been accused of being a strict rationalist with a penchant for the nostalgic, I believe a clearer description of his work would be the one that T. S. Eliot applied to the wit of the seventeenth-century poet Andrew Marvell: "tough reasonableness beneath the lyric grace." Such wit is an alliance of levity and seriousness (by which the seriousness is intensified); it has a toughness that might be mistaken by the tender-minded for cynicism.<br> <br>When Leo Steinberg wrote his monograph on Johns in 1962, he generously offered grounds for criticizing it. Acknowledging that his book was subjective, that he had said nothing about the paintings as such or that he had reduced them inconclusively to ideas or concepts, he concluded, "He treats Jasper Johns in complete isolation, as if nobody else were painting at all!" All of the above is also true of this book, and it is extraordinary that, more than twenty years after Steinberg, the impulse is still to write about the work in isolation. The work appears to demand an exclusive attention and so is set apart from other works of a similar date. But if the works themselves are exclusive, their effects have been multifarious. It is commonplace now to regard Johns as having had enormous influence over the last thirty years, and it may be worth pausing to consider some of the consequences of this.<br> <br>Johns' peers are those artists born in the 1920s and 30s who have also changed the history of American art: Ellsworth Kelly, Robert Rauschenberg, Claes Oldenburg, and Andy Warhol. Collectively (except Kelly, who was heavily imbued with European experience), they were labeled "Pop artists," a term invented by critics to provide a useful catchall for superficially similar work in both the United States and England. Pop was a helpful invention, but its concentration on the non art content of the works was detrimental to a real understanding of the motives of the artists. It may be easier to reconcile this view with the British artists, whose discussions included cultural historians, designers, and architects, but the Americans themselves seem isolated. It is true that they met and talked, but I suspect without the same proselytizing intentions.<br> <br>Johns and his contemporaries were concerned with tackling the problems set out for them by the preceding generation, the Abstract Expressionists. Pollock had died in 1956, and we have only to recall that when Johns was looking for a gallery the following year he was anxious to find a neutral space, that is, one not infected by the second Abstract Expressionist generation. The weight of this generation would have fallen particularly heavily on the younger artists at a time when the Abstract Expressionists were being promoted extensively, at home and abroad, as the "true" American artists. Additionally, Abstract Expressionism had accrued a critical vocabulary and eminent apologists, such as Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg, who regarded it as the true heir of modern art proper and the flagbearer for modernism. Abstract Expressionism and modernism became synonymous.<br> <br>Johns' entry into this arena with his <i>Flag</i> and <i>Target</i> paintings signaled, for some, the end of the Abstract Expressionist stranglehold. He has put it another way. When talking to Peter Fuller in 1978, he denied that Abstract Expressionism had been looking tired and said: "Any ism will expire. By having an ism you are separating it from other things. Your attention has to deal with the entire field. Things displace one another in ones interest." The relative neutrality of the <i>Flags</i> and <i>Targets,</i> their acknowledgment of sources outside art was iconoclastic. They caused a rupture in critical thinking, and Greenberg even wrote: "Everything that used to serve representation and illusion is left to serve nothing but itself, that is abstraction; while everything that usually connotes the abstract or decorative&#x2014;flatness, bare outlines, all over or symmetrical design is put to the service of representation."</p><h2>Say You&#39;re One of Them (Oprah&#39;s Book Club)</h2><p>Each story in this jubilantly acclaimed collection pays testament to the wisdom and resilience of children, even in the face of the most agonizing circumstances. <br><br>A family living in a makeshift shanty in urban Kenya scurries to find gifts of any kind for the impending Christmas holiday.

Aboard a bus filled with refugees&#x2014;a microcosm of today&#x2019;s Africa&#x2014;a Muslim boy summons his faith to bear a treacherous ride across Nigeria. Through the eyes of childhood friends the emotional toll of religious conflict in Ethiopia becomes viscerally clear. <br><br>Uwem Akpan&#x2019;s debut signals the arrival of a breathtakingly talented writer who gives a matter-of-fact reality to the most extreme circumstances in stories that are nothing short of transcendent.</p><p>Uwem Akpan was born in Ikot Akpan Eda in southern Nigeria. After studying philosophy and English at Creighton and Gonzaga universities, he studied theology for three years at the Catholic University of Eastern Africa. He was ordained as a Jesuit priest in 2003 and received his MFA in creative writing from the University of Michigan in 2006. <em>My Parents&#x2019; Bedroom</em>, a story from his short story collection, Say You&#x2019;re One of Them, was one of five short stories by African writers chosen as finalists for The Caine Prize for African Writing 2007. Say You&#x2019;re One of Them won the Commonwealth Writers&#x2019; Prize for Best First Book (Africa Region) 2009 and PEN/Beyond Margins Award 2009, and was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Art Seidenbaum Award for First Fiction. In 2007, Akpan taught at a Jesuit college in Harare, Zimbabwe. Now he serves at Christ the King Church, Ilasamaja-Lagos, Nigeria.This abridgment includes three stories from Nigerian writer Uwem Akpan&#39;s collection. The title story, &#34;Say You&#39;re One of Them,&#34; recounts horrifying days in the Rwandan Hutu-Tutsi conflict, narrated in the first person by a young girl. Robin Miles adopts a lovely French-African accent, and if she allows Akpan&#39;s beautiful turns of phrase to shine, the underlying tension and fear are also never far from the surface. Miles also narrates &#34;What Language Is That?&#34; This story is partially unaccented, a choice that accentuates the second-person point of view. &#34;An Ex-Mas Feast&#34; follows the sometimes-humorous, sometimes-bleak fortunes of a street family in Nairobi. Dion Graham, in Kenyan-accented English, successfully embodies the family&#39;s mother and father, teenaged daughter, and young son. Overall, not an easy listen, but a worthwhile one.

The painting has been interpreted as a heretical masterpiece, an opulent illustration of the Creation and a premonition of the end of the world. In this new flexi-cover edition of the book, renowned art historian Hans Belting offers a radical reinterpretation of the work, which he sees not as apocalyptic, but utopian, portraying how the world would exist had the Fall not happened. Taking readers through each panel, Belting discusses various schools of thought and explores Bosch&#39;s life and times. Enhanced by a fold-out reproduction of the original painting, this fascinating study is an important contribution to the literature and theory surrounding one of the world&#39;s most enigmatic artists.</p><p>Hieronymus Bosch&#x2019;s elaborate paintings have always been hugely popular as well as controversial. His landscapes depicting humans, animals, and fabulous creatures in various states of ecstasy and misery were greatly imitated by his contemporaries and laid the foundations for the Surrealist movement of the 20th century. But of all Bosch&#x2019;s works, The Garden of Earthly Delights, located in the Prado Museum in Madrid, has provoked the most debate. Commissioned by a wealthy Dutch noble, the painting has been interpreted as a heretical masterpiece, a condemnation of Catholicism, an opulent illustration of the Creation, and a premonition of the end of the world. Now Hans Belting offers his own reading of the work, which he sees not as apocalyptic, but utopian. Taking readers through each panel, Belting discusses various schools of thought, and explores Bosch&#x2019;s life and times. He compares Bosch&#x2019;s vision with the humanistic theories of Thomas More and Willibald Pirckheimer and suggests that the painter&#x2019;s aim was not to evoke the end of the world, but to investigate how the world would exist had the Fall not happened. Enhanced by an exquisite fold-out reproduction of the original painting, this fascinating study is an important contribution to the literature and theory surrounding one of the world&#x2019;s most enigmatic artists.Few paintings inspire the kind of intense study and speculation as the &#34;Garden of Earthly Delights,&#34; the luminous triptych by Nertherlandish master Hieronymus Bosch.

Color-coded boxes containing facts, historical details, profiles and more combine with the general layout to ensure that there is always one more thing for the reader to investigate, making this book hard to put down (though its heft makes it hard to hold up). The striking cover image of a massive eye gives readers the impression that they&#x2019;re being examined in extreme detail by the book itself, a feeling that is perpetuated within. The book addresses seven overarching aspects of mankind: origins, body, mind, life cycle, society, culture and peoples. In these sections, readers discover why their palms sweat when they&#x2019;re nervous, how tongue-rolling can explain genetics, what the connection between language and thought is, why in-laws are never a problem in Papua New Guinea, how different economic systems work, what insult is the earliest we learn and where in the world nearly man-sized stones are used as money. The varied arrangement of the images gives this volume less of an encyclopedic feel than the previous book in DK&#x2019;s Smithsonian series (Animal), and the visuals are often compelling. Unlike many occasionally-flipped-through coffee table books, this impressive volume is sure to become a much-used household reference. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Fast and frenetic in their leather jackets and torn jeans, the Ramones gave voice to the disaffected youth of the seventies and eighties, influenced countless bands, and inspired the counterculture for decades to come. <p> </p><p> Born Jeffry Hyman of Queens, New York, Joey Ramone was the quirky, extraordinary lead singer and cofounder of the band. Hiding his face behind signature sunglasses and a mop of dark hair, he helped define punk's early image, and his two-decade-plus tenure as the Ramones' front man made him unforgettable. Told by Joey's brother, Mickey Leigh, <i>I Slept with Joey Ramone</i> provides an intimate look at the turbulent life of one of America's greatest -- and unlikeliest -- music icons. </p><p> </p><p> With honesty, humor, and grace, Mickey shares the fascinating, sometimes troubling story of growing up with an emotionally distressed brother who becomes a rock star and the effect it had on their family. He shows how Joey used music to cope with mental illness; embraced the glam nightlife of the New York scene; launched CBGB alongside bands like the Talking Heads and Blondie; and brought punk to Britain, clashing with the Sex Pistols and changing music history. </p><p> </p><p> Ultimately, betrayal and infighting would end the band. While the music lives on for new generations to discover, <i>I Slept with Joey Ramone</i> is the enduring portrait of a man who struggled to find his voice and of the brother who loved him. </p><p></p></p><p><b>Mickey Leigh</b>, born Mitch Hyman, has been a major player in the rock n roll world since the late seventies.

My mother, my brother, and I had recently moved into a new high-rise apartment building in Forest Hills, Queens, with a spectacular view of Manhattan.</p><p>I was sitting in our new bedroom with Arlene, a friend who&#x2019;d stopped by after our last class at Forest Hills High School. We could see the entire skyline from my bed by the window and watched the sun set over Manhattan. Arlene gazed at the city lights as I passed her the joint.</p><p>All of a sudden, on the other side of the bedroom there was a stirring beneath a huge, homegrown pile of rubble. It was as if this unidentifiable mass of a mess had taken on an animated life of its own.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that!?&#x201d; Arlene asked in a hushed but urgent tone; she was ready to bolt should the inexplicable commotion continue.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s my brother,&#x201d; I answered, deadpan.</p><p>On one side of the bedroom by the window was your average teenage mess, plus a few oddities: a skinny ten-inch-long mirrored hash pipe made by Mexican Indians; an eight-track tape deck; an issue of the <i>East Village Other</i>; a copy of How to <i>Talk Dirty and Influence People</i> by Lenny Bruce; and some guitar picks.</p><p>On the other side, my brother&#x2019;s side, was the pile.</p><p>It had levels, or more like tiers: clean and dirty shirts; pants, socks, and assorted underwear; a pair of brown suede, calf-high fringed boots (like the ones Ian Anderson wore on the cover of the Jethro Tull album <i>Stand Up</i>); all covered by a huge Afghan shepherd&#x2019;s coat. Below, in another layer, were records, newspapers, rock magazines, and wrappers and boxes from various food groups, all surrounded by dishes, cups, and glasses that doubled as ashtrays, containing liquids that had created multicolored foam&#x2014;beer-mug-type heads that had risen up to and above the rims of the glasses.</p><p>Sheets and blankets snaked their way in and out of the living sculpture. An unseen mattress lay on the floor supporting the escalating geological wonder that was my brother&#x2019;s side of the room.</p><p>&#x201c;Uh, are you sure that&#x2019;s him?&#x201d; Arlene asked, somewhat confused, in that I hadn&#x2019;t even glanced over in the direction of the mysterious mass. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see anybody.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s him,&#x201d; I replied, &#x201c;unless there&#x2019;s a new tenant in there that I don&#x2019;t know about.&#x201d;</p><p>Arlene giggled, half genuinely, half nervously.</p><p>Hearing our voices, my brother cleared through enough of the debris to pop his head up and see what was going on.</p><p>His sunglasses were already on.</p><p>They were rarely off.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, how ya doin&#x2019;?&#x201d; he said to Arlene. They&#x2019;d seen each other around the neighborhood.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay,&#x201d; Arlene said to my brother. &#x201c;Did we wake you up?&#x201d;</p><p>Looking out the window and seeing that it was almost dark, my brother replied, &#x201c;No, no, that&#x2019;s okay, I was up.&#x201d;</p><p>As he started to clear his way out of the heap, we realized <i>he didn&#x2019;t have any pants on.</i></p><p>Arlene said, &#x201c;You know, I kinda gotta get goin&#x2019;. I told Alan I&#x2019;d stop upstairs.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;My mom will be home soon, anyway.&#x201d;</p><p>I moved to the middle of the room to shield Arlene&#x2019;s view.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t have many girls come over after that.</p><p>My brother&#x2014;the guy without the pants&#x2014;lived on to become Joey Ramone, with quite an amazing story.</p><p>I lived on to tell it.</p><p>ï¿½ 2009 Mickey Leigh</p></p><h2>Forever Wicked: A Wicked Lovers Novella (1001 Dark Nights)</h2><p>They had nothing in common but a desperate passion...

Tour.</p><p>Let's say you're a 50-, 40-, or even 30-year-old man. Maybe you want to evict that donut of fat that's moved into the space where your waist used to be, or it could be that the hike upstairs has you rethinking that downstairs bathroom you never installed, or perhaps you just saw a picture of your 19-year-old self in your football uniform. Or maybe you just want to be healthier and fitter than you already are. Well, you can be--and Dr. Bob will tell you exactly how to do it, with an engaging writing style, vast enthusiasm, and an emphasis on fast results. <p> In this for-men-only book (because "It has become politically incorrect for men to write books for women"), Dr. Bob Arnot--of NBC News medical correspondent fame--will convince even the most committed sloth that a 25-year-old body can be only months away. According to Arnot, revolutions in fitness technology, nutrition, and sports medicine now make it possible for a middle-ager to bench press the years back to a biological age of 25 or so--in as little as six months. Arnot calls on an impressive array of experts and scientific findings to bolster his prescription: an eat-as-much-as-you-want diet of low-fat, whole-grain foods--and play! </p><p> Arnot offers advice on sports as play for adults (alpine skiing, aerobic tennis, power blading, mountain biking, and snow blading--also known as cross-country skiing), including the challenges of new skills, getting the right coach, smart training, and fast recoveries. Nutrition plays a big part in the Arnot regimen, and he offers up information on nutritional snacks and sports food, multicultural cuisine ideas, as well as recipes and dietary supplements. </p><p> "If there is a fountain of youth, it is the heavy metal in your local gym," Arnot says, because the real fitness pitfall for the not-20-anymore man is muscle loss. From deltoids to dumbbells and pecs to pull-ups, Arnot runs down gym musts and hows in an illustrated weight-training program. Add Arnot's visualization techniques and aphorisms to the mix ("Conventional Wisdom: Go with the flow. New Paradigm: Aging is a cultural trap that programs men to abuse, misuse, and disuse their bodies"), and men past the "golden age" of their 20s may well find that the goal of getting fit, staying fit, and rewinding the biological clock is truly within reach. <i>--Stefanie Durbin</i></p>Before tackling the serious discussion of improved diet and fitness, Arnot, medical correspondent for CBS News and a self-described "aerobic animal," recounts his own exhaustive adventurous in exercise land. His exuberance sets the stage for this substantive, sensible guide addressed to the 30-to 60-year-old male. Arnot contends that men within this age span can crank back the hands on their biological clocks by changing their diet (high on slow-burning carbohydrates and fiber, low on fatty proteins and sugars) and by beginning a vigorous program of aerobics and weight-training. An extensive chapter on multicultural eating names healthful dishes (not recipes) from various ethnic cuisines. An illustrated and user-friendly guide to weight training includes excercises that anyone can do at the gym. Much here will be equally useful to female readers. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p>
